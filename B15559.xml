            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no new thing, (for ſtuffe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) which I offer to thee in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing tract: how can I, in an Argument of this nature, wherein the obiect deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the minde and pen of the Writer? If therefore nouelty be thy ayme, ſaue thy labour. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the manner and order of expreſſion, this I would ſay, That as the Ancients, looke what they deſired to faſten vpon themſelues or their children, they were wont to conueigh it in the familiarity of a Song or Rime, that it might become their owne with eaſe: So doe I heere, vnder the eaſe and familiarneſſe of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, (which is no other then a forme of godlineſſe) reach out to thee and thine, a direction to Heauen, ſo that if hereby the truth as it is in Ieſus, may be emplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy ſpirit in any meaſure, I haue my deſire. Thou wilt ſay, Who-euer denyed but Catechiſme ſerues to this end? I anſwere, I wiſh that the practice of all that catechize and are catechized did approue it. The ſlight
<pb facs="tcp:177956:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> anſwer of men betrayes them, who being asked, If their Miniſter did preach to day? anſwere, No: hee did but Catechize: If the Preaching of a Catechiſt were conceaued as his beſt worke, could men ſo ſpeake? No ſurely, were Catechizing vſed to ſuch ſolemne ends, none but barbarous and blynd ones could be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the eminency and fruit thereof. I taxe none: I onely adde, As I bleſſe God that Catechizing is ſo frequent, and that there are many able Preachers who ayme at a profitable courſe: So I wiſh that all who do not, would follow ſuch examples.</p>
            <p>As touching you, my Chriſtian Auditors: You know, one full third part of my poore labors hath beene thus (and in this order and ayme) to Catechize. And whereas <hi>Iob</hi> ſerued in the preaching hereof, that the particulars grew to a larger extent then I looked for; you know that once a yeere at leaſt, I gaue you a briefe view of all the parts in a few Sermons. Which courſe becauſe I ſaw to be profitable then: therefore (bethinking my ſelfe now in this my priuacy, how I might witnes the continuing care of my heart for your good) I haue conceaued the reuiuing of that Method, to be the beſt way to recommend my loue vnto you. Written copies I ſaw would prooue ſo chargeable, that few would haue enioyed any benefit heereof: and threfore I yeelded for your eaſe (to that which my ſelfe would haue ſhunned) to print the Copy.</p>
            <p>I proceeded, you know, (in my Miniſtery) towards the end of the Satiſfaction, being the ſecond Branch of the ſecond part. I haue by my labor ſince (with Gods bleſſings) added the reſt of the Parts and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb facs="tcp:177956:3"/> to the end: handling both one and other (for the moſt part) according to the proportion of my larger courſe: at leaſt few points of Subſtance omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Your loſſe (in a ſort) becomes your gaine in this, That wereas ſcarce in 2 yeeres you ſhould haue heard that which is heere added: Lo, now you haue it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to you at once. Let not (in any caſe) this gaine of yours become your loſſe by careleſneſſe: but let it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our diligence become a double gaine to you and yours.</p>
            <p>Now to the intent that this view of Catechiſme may be profitable, in few words conceaue it thus. Three words containe all my ſcope in this Tract: Sinne, Grace, Obedience, Sinne, in the firſt part, that each vnregenerate man may know how to get out of his falſe peace, ſeeing himſelfe in the glaſſe of the Law to be that curſed one. Grace, in the ſecond, that each humbled one vnder his burden, may (in the mirror of the Goſpell, and the offer of Reconciliation) behold and embrace the hearty and vnfeigned meaning of the Lord to forgiue and ſaue him. Obedience in the third, that each forgiuen ſoule may know, that God, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him mercy, aymes not onely at the eaſe of the ſoules burden, but at his owne honor, in laying on another burden, (though eazy and ſweet) of liuing by faith, and obeying his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. Set theſe three then before thy eye as the ſcope of the whole: And ſo each part ſhall not onely profit thee in the ſeuerall branches, but much more in the connexion of the ſcope thereof; all tending to make the ſoule happy here and heereafter. If then thou meet in the firſt part with many Articles &amp; heads of weight, reſt not in the doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:177956:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the things, but conceaue them from firſt to laſt, as ſteps and degrees to conuince thee of ſinne: that the ſence of thy naturall eſtate may make thee and leaue thee ſuch an one in thine owne eyes, as thou art in the LORDS. If in the ſecond thou meete with ſundry diſcourſes of the way and meane of Deliuerance, dwell not vpon the points them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but conſider their ſcope, that GOD, in offring thee Chriſts Righteouſnes to bee thine, ſpeakes as truly and according to his purpoſe, in this, as hee did in the firſt, that hee might conuince thee of his Righteouſnes. Likewiſe in the third ſo reade and mediate of the grounds therein contained, as remembring that all of them tend to this one marke, That the truth as it is in Ieſus, muſt conuince thee of as great a neceſſity of putting off the old and putting on the new man, as before it did of thy Righteouſneſſe. And thus thy reading ouer and ouer this Treatiſe with meditation and prayer, may through the Grace of Gods Spirit, lead thee towards Heauen.</p>
            <p>And now behold, I would euen deſire that, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> dealt with his Prophecies,<note place="margin">Iere. 36.2.</note> he wrote them in a Role, that they might be in daily view, and better beleeued: So thoſe of my people (for I accuſe but ſome) who would neuer by the preaching of theſe poynts, vnderſtand the coherence and vſe of this Summe of Godlineſſe, might now ſtand vpon this Piſgah,<note place="margin">Deut. vlt. 1.</note> and behold this <hi>Canaan</hi> of Practicall Religion, and that goodly <hi>Lebanon</hi> thereof eſpecially, I meane the Doctrine of fayth in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and the new Creature. The vſe of the whole Poſie of al the Flowers herein bound together is, That
<pb facs="tcp:177956:4"/> yee bee better grounded in knowledge, and heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons dayly with better vnderſtanding, diſcerning and practice. Read therefore and conſider. Pray for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing alſo, that this Treatiſe may returne into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes with double fruit. If you profit not, how ſhall ſtrangers? In hope whereof, I commend your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lord, and my ſelfe to your prayers. Farewell.</p>

            <head>The order of this view.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, I will chuſe ſuch Scriptures as doe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in briefe containe the ſumme of each of the three parts; premiſing a text to each part, that we may heare God, and not man to ſpeake. Then in the ſecond place I will more fully ſubioyne the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Articles of each part, which belong thereto, with the proofes, openings and vſe thereof. And both theſe in forme of Catechizing.</p>
            <p>The text for the firſt part.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>TITVS 3.3:</hi>
               </bibl> 
               <p>For we alſo were in times paſt, vnwiſe, diſobedient, deceaued, ſeruing the luſts and diuers pleaſures, liuing in maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and enuy, hatefull, and hating one another.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>WHat is the connexion of this text?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Cretians, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued the profeſſion of the Goſpell vpon them, teaching them to beleeue in Chriſt the Lord of all, and to ſtand faſt in the liberty by him purchaſed to the conſcience; began to thinke themſelues too good to ſerue their Superiours, Princes, Magiſtrates, or Maſters. But
<pb facs="tcp:177956:8"/> the Apoſtle preſſeth them to a cloſe obedience and walking with God; both in this and all other commandements. And hee vrgeth this point of obedience to GOD and man (which is the ſumme of the third part of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme) by a compariſon of the firſt and ſecond parts of the Catechiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> Sinne and grace; thus, It were a ſhame for Chriſtians to walke vnder grace, as they did before, during the tyme of ſinne and ignorance. But of this latter ſort were ye <hi>Cretians,</hi> ſometimes, <hi>viz.</hi> fooliſh, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, deceaued, &amp;c. Now, ſince the Grace of God appeared, ye are ſaued and vnder grace. Bee aſhamed therefore to liue now as then, and become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee by this Argument the three parts of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme are couched together.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the meaning of the third verſe, in which the Doctrine of the firſt part is conteined?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He deſcribes the miſery vnder which theſe <hi>Cretians</hi> lay in their vnregeneracy. In which although all be not ſayd which other Scriptures conteine; yet ſo much is ſayd, as may be a ground-worke to the reſt. The order is this. Firſt hee layes downe the miſery of their mindes: they were <hi>Fooliſh,</hi> that is, void of all ſound knowledge in Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or their owne good, meere ſpirituall fooles in the midſt of their carnall wiſdome. This fooliſhnes, is partly Originall, partly actuall. Originall is the deprauednes of the vnderſtanding, and the guilt thereof. As in fooles there is a naturall diſability of the powers and Organs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo an vtter impotency to reach the truth of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen ſo in all naturall men, whether vnder me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ues or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them they are fooles in reſpect of wiſdome to ſaluation. And, as Law ſtrips fooles of all right to an eſtate, making them obnoxious to a kind of miſery: ſo doth ſpirituall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance robbe the ſoule of Heauen. Secondly, this fooliſhnes is actuall, ſtanding in the natural defilement of the mind, with all idle and erroneous thoughts of God &amp; themſelues, with pollution of iudgement and vnderſtanding iſſuing thence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177956:9"/>
            <p>Q. <hi>What elſe doth the Apoſtle adde?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The next is, Corruptednes of the heart or will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the terme of <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> which is alſo Originall or Actuall. Originall is the vtter loſſe of true freedome of the will, in point of Subiection to the mind. So that, as the mind is wholy blynd, ſo is the will wholy rebellious and vnſubiect, voide of all ſubmiſſion to any Commands of God, quite auerſe from any thing which hee doth or can impoze: And the guilt heerof is lyablenes to wrath or Iuſtice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hence iſſue all Actuall habits of Rebellion, as Impiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vnrighteouſnes, intemperancy and the like.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is this all which Paul deſcribes ſinne by?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: hee vſeth three other deſcriptions: firſt he ſayth <hi>they were deceaued,</hi> that is, As a foole is cheated eaſily by euery one: ſo is a ſpirituall foole: this toucheth the Actuall Sinnes of the mind. The ſecond is <hi>Seruing luſts:</hi> which implyes a Slauery to the Deuill, world and luſts, luſts of the heart, luſts of the eye, and pride of life: as a beaſt led to the Shambles. The third is, Trading and Conuerſing in actuall ſinnes, ſuch as accord with the particular nature of each ſinner: ſome of which diſtempers are noted, a few of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moneſt for all the reſt, <hi>Pleaſures &amp; riot, enuy, hating, &amp; being hated, &amp;c.</hi> all which are added to giue a bitter relliſh to this miſery.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>Why ſayth he nothing of the other part of miſery, ſtanding in the curſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not becauſe he excludes any eſſentiall part of it, but becauſe one text will not conteine all, but that which the drift of it lyes vnto. Some texts include all three parts in one Verſe, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. Some expreſſe one generall part, ſome another, and in that part, ſome one Branch, ſome another. Therefore what is heere lacking, muſt bee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by ſome other. This for a ground of Scripture may ſame, and its good that ſuch draughts of Scriptures bee before our eyes, when we handle theſe grounds, that as corner ſtones, they may hold in the building.

               <p>Q. <hi>Why, was not man thus miſerable from the beginning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, in no ſort. For God created <hi>man, male and female in his owne image, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. Read the places. <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the matter: in reſpect of his better part, he was made a ſpirituall, immortall, inuiſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellegible being, as God. A little ſparke of diuinity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the maner, as the one Gods eſſence is ſubſiſtng in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo one ſoule in three powers, as naturall, ſenſible, &amp; reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For endowments, and qualities, pure, lightſome, orderly, righteous, holy, and perfect in act, though not in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177956:10"/> and ſtability: righteous, but not righteouſnes, (for thats the Goſpels worke) not immutable, but left to his freedom of will. Fourthly. In his body, although of Earth, yet by the breath of God putting life into the earthy frame thereof, hee was made a creature of great authority and maieſty, a modell of the creation: as in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 8. Read it ouer. <hi>A Lord and Souereigne</hi> vnder the Creator of all his creatures vnder himſelfe. A ſtrange Maſterpiece for all to ſtoop to, euen as he onely to ſtoop to his Creator. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>A little lower then the Angels:</hi> a petty Vice-roy vnder the Lord himſelfe. The very ruines of him are admirable, as when wee behold the rubbiſh of ſome Palace, wee may gueſſe at the firſt magnificence of it a far off: ſo when we ſee the admirable reliques hereof in <hi>Philoſophers, Moraliſts, Politicians, Artiſts,</hi> and naturall effects of men, we may gueſſe at the originall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. May there be any thing more diſtinctly ſpoken hereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes: for order ſake, wee may conſider this Image of God, in reſpect of theſe three: Firſt, Body. Secondly, Soule. 3. Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Touching the body firſt, how was Adam therein created?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We may conſider therein two things. Firſt, The producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or making thereof. Secondly. The frame of it beeing made.</p>
               <p>For the former, the Lord addreſſes himſelfe to it, more ſolemnly then other Creatures (for this concernes his body as well as his ſoule) <hi>Let vs make man:</hi> not thus, Let man be. As to the other creatures. The Trinity is called to this worke, noting it ſhould be Diuine and excellent.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The frame of it: being made, it was ſo as God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, a ſpeciall reſemblance of the Creator: He made not the ſoule, but man, conſiſting of body and ſoule, according to the Image of GOD. So that, whatſoeuer reſemblance the other creatures had,<note place="margin">Verſe. 26. twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</note> remotely: <hi>Adam</hi> had an immediate, neere and engrauen character of Gods Image, as might be in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall thing.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conſider it in theſe 3 things. Firſt. The organicalnes: that it ſhould bee a materiall inſtrument created with peculiar aptnes and fitnes for the ſeruice and execution of an immateriall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſoule: yea euery way in all points moſt inſtrumentall.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that out of ſo baſe and earthly a ſubſtance, the Lord ſhould rayſe vp a mixture and conſtitution of elementary, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177956:10"/> yet immortall, and durable nature, neuer to dye: with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent freedome from all alterations, or impreſſions by <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, or Infirmityes,</hi> tending to diſſolution of the ſame; al paines, diſtempers, weaknes, or the like, remoued; (actually I meane.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A difference of habit, of proportion, and geſture from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all other creatures: For ſuch reuerend markes there were, in the colour, temper, guiſe, awfulnes, erectnes, and gate of man, as cauſed all creatures to ſtoope and do obeyſance. The heathens obſerued it, in the vpward looke of man, and the prone downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward looke of other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. But the Holy Ghoſt eſpecially ayming at the ſoule: proceed to ſpeake of that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The ſoule of man reſembled the Creator much more: and that in three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The nature of it, like Gods (as hath bin ſayd) incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> intelligible, immortall, free to will or nill: nothing in it groſſe, carnall, or baſe: the purpoſe, counſell, vnderſtanding, deliberating, reſoluing, diſcourſing and iudging faculties being Diuine ſparks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the manner, I ſpake in the former queſtion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſeuerall functions and powers thereof, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reſembling the communicable Attributes of GOD, in their perfection: his knowledge, his pureneſſe, his freedome, his righteouſnes: Theſe may be referred to 2 ſorts: inward and outward, The inward ſtanding in vnderſtanding, will and conſcience: The vnderſtanding hauing perfect knowledge of God his nature, attributes, will and worſhip, of himſelfe, of all other things, yea the formes and very natures thereof, whence he gaue them Names: in all reſpects his vnderſtanding was an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> of diſtinct, pure and perfect light: ſo was his will (as I may ſay) a <hi>Thummim</hi> of <hi>Holines,</hi> perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, originall rectitude, and was thorowly ſubiect to the edict and charge of the mind: and ſo the operations and actions ſutable to both.</p>
               <p>GOD then ſate in the throne of the mynde as ſupreme, the will was ſubiect to the mynd, the actions to both. In the conſcience, he enioyed a pure and true reflexe of himſelfe in all theſe: perfectly gladding and comforting himſelfe in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity to this excellency: a Muſicall harmony without all iarre, remorſe or anxiety. The outward acts of the Sences, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177956:11"/> naturall, ciuill, oeconomicall or religious, ordered by knowledge. There was poſitiue power and free will to good, and not euill in his nature, (and to euill onely negatiue:) as now in the vnregenerate there is a freedome to euill and not good: and in the regenerate, partly to good, partly to euill. Onely not vnchangeably ſo: not becauſe (as ſome dreame) he muſt then haue bene as God: for many Angels were created ſo, and yet but creatures: but becauſe it pleaſed the Creator ſo farre and no further to impart himſelfe vnto him, for cauſes whereof baſe curioſity muſt not deſcant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. What Image of God was in his perſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That which I ſpake of his bodily excellency (for the inſtrumentalnes,) is much truer of his whole Perſon, that it was an expreſſe image of God, <hi>Firſt,</hi> in his moſt reuerend and awfull behauior, as being vnder God the Lord of the Creatures. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that honorable enterteynment vouchafed him by the Lord, euen as a Prince into his Palace; all the world beeing finiſhed in her due parts and ornaments, man is brought in as The royall Creature, poſſeſſed of all the rich treaſure of the Creation, ſet therein as in a Theater of the workmanſhip of God, that all ſhould bee ſubiect to him. But touching this, and thoſe 2 or 3 next Articles (of which and in which there is leſſe doubt and difficulty) I will ſhorten my ſelfe: vntill I come to ioyne iſſue with the practice of this firſt part, <hi>viz.</hi> the vſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. What vſe then is there to be made thereof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Manifold: for although the crooked nature of man thinkes it but her miſery, to thinke how happy ſhee hath bene: yet the Lord purpoſeth by this meanes, to bring her backe to her firſt excellency, if ſhe wilbe ruled by him.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Firſt then this ſhould teach vs to adore that deep workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, which once enſtamped ſuch a liuely Image of himſelfe in man, as cannot be quite defaced, no not by ſinne it ſelfe, I meane, in reſpect of ſome Characters of it which by his mercifull prouidence hee hath left in common nature, not onely in the Notions of the mynd, but the Image of the perſon.</p>
               <p>This poynt wil better ſute the third Article: here onely I bring it in, to ſtirre vs vp to 2 meditations: Firſt, If ſin (as defacing a blemiſh as it is) yet could not ſo quite roote out that honour
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177956:11"/> and Maieſty of God in man, but ſtill he hath reſerued (for vniuerſall ends) ſome reliques thereof: (for whence is it, that the Lord hath denyed thoſe vſefull creatures, the horſe and the Oxe and others, to feele their owne ſtrength, and the curſe of man, ſo that they ſhould quite renounce his ſeruice? Do they not ſtill feare the Shadow of Gods Image, and are they not awefull, nay do they not yeeld themſelues to his taming and ſubduing power?) euen Lyons, and Beares, and the moſt ſauage? If then there be ſuch a deepe Print of this Creating hand; with an indelable character in his ſecond I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in righteouſnes, enſtamped by the Spirit of Chriſt; who dare ſay, that any thing can euer deface that laſting I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> what reuerend reſpect ſhould we yeeld to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ruined Image of God in the Creature? who ſhould dare to mocke and diſdaine thoſe whom God hath doubly impayred his Image in; euen the lame, the blynd, the deafe, the impotent, and crooked? ſtill there ſhould be a due reſpect to the firſt copy, and this deformity ſhould rather cauſe vs wonder at that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, which ſuffers not all men in their birth to bring in the markes of this ruined Image of God, then to ſcorne ſuch as haue! See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.34.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> eſpecially it ſhould ſmite a terror &amp; awe into vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of their perſons, to whom the Lord hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of inferiors, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Parents &amp; Superiors, yea although vnſanctified; but much more if renued by grace: let vs behold God in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſeruing his authority in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thogh they haue raz'd it out by their ſin. If the deſpiſer of the pooreſt (not religious) diſhonor his Maker: how much mroe ſuch as diſdaine the gifts of God in thoſe that are learned, experienced, wiſe and of good, comely carriage, perſonage, and behauior?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nay: how feareful a confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do they bring in, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> adde a ſecond defacing to this once defaced, (yet indulgently continued) Image of God, abuſing their parts of Authority, of Policy, of Eſteeme, of Beauty, good perſonage, preſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, to the abominable mayntenance of ſin, profaneneſſe, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, whoredome, oppreſſion, rapine, flattery or the like? Shall God giue them a toird reſtitution?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the recogniſance of this firſt Image of GOD, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:177956:12"/> ſhould occaſion to vs (that now by the Miniſtery of the Law are conuinced of our wofull loſſe) firſt, to ſhame our ſelues: ſecondly, to prouoke our ſelues.</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> To ſhame our ſelues firſt, by the reflex of our odious &amp; degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate qualities, vpon our owne ſpirits. Oh! that one created to immortality and vertue in the Image of his Creator, ſhould ſo deeply and far diſguize and forget himſelfe, as to bow to an Idoll of wood and ſtone! to grub heere in the pit of this world baſe pebbles &amp; dirt, thinking the atteyning thereof to be an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines? nay to grow to ſuch villany, as to deſtroy the Image of God by bloodſhed &amp; cruelty? would it bee thought that it were poſſible for any to decline ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that originall, if they did but know it? If that heathen thought it a reaſonable ſpeech, what can ſeeme great in this world to him, by whom the frame and demenſions of the whole world are comprehended? how much more here? what wealth, profits, baſe pleaſures, riot, drunken<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe can ſeeme ſweet, to whom that beautifull Image of God (according to which he was firſt made) is made himſelfe knowne? how ſhould common ſence ſhame ſuch?</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Secondly, how ſhould the thought hereof prouoke ſuch (as are not quite forlorne) both to mourne, that for ſo baſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and luſts ſake, they haue deſpiſed ſo great graces as haue bin offred them; and alſo excite their appetite (as oft as they heare the Lord offer to reſtore them againe to their integrity, to long after it, and to grone vnder their inabilty to beleeue it? ſaying, Oh Lord, I was borne to excellency and honor: and ſhall not thy perſwaſions draw my heart to recouer my loſt ſtate? If we had but loſt a faire picture of our Father, would we not hearken after it; and ſhould not ech day ſeeme ten to vs, (when we may regaine it) till the Lord hath ſettled it againe in Chriſt vpon vs?</p>
               <p> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> Thirdly, this is Inſtruction, to teach vs not onely the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable <hi>Excellency</hi> of the fountain it ſelfe, a drop of which lighted vpon man, as <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 8. concludes: but in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular alſo, and eſpecially the goodnes of this Maieſty, who would communciate himſelfe not onely to Angels, but to a piece of earth, and that in ſo ſtrange a manner, to make it capable of ſuch perfection.

               <p>Fourthly, it ſhould teach vs much more to beleeue, how <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> admired he can make himſelfe in all his Siants, by his ſecond creation, eſpecially at his ſecond comming; and the whileſt, in repayring of his Image more perfectly in thoſe that beleeue; faith beeing a greater excellency, and tending to a neerer vnion then euer any perfection of <hi>Adam.</hi> Oh! it ſhould conuince vs of the goodnes of mercy, and caſt out that enmity of ours, which cannot beteame God one good thought.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it ſhould teach vs the equity of Gods commands, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> and iuſtice of his threats euen againſt our corrupt nature. For the Lord lookes not at our inability, but his owne goodnes, in the enabling of vs once to obey. And whereas ſome cauillers alledge, that <hi>Adam</hi> had not faith giuen him, therefore GOD cannot iuſtly require the puniſhment of vnbeleefe. I anſwer yes: for although <hi>Adam</hi> had not the grace he needed not, yet he had ſuch grace as enabled him to <hi>obey, aſwell</hi> in thoſe charges which God ſhould put vpon him, which he loſing by ſinne, is iuſtly puniſht for it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it ſhould ſtop the mouth of all cauillers againſt God, <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. But, did Adam continue in this integrity?</hi>

               <p>A. No. He fell from it by wilfull tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. And this diſobedience, was the violation of the charge of God, not to meddle with the Tree of Good and euill. This ſin was not a bare eating of the forbidden fruit, but a compound and fardell of all ſinnes in one; <hi>A proud, diſloyall, needleſſe, diſtruſtfull, reuolting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, vnthankfull, rebellious departing</hi> from the bleſſed God, to a baſe creature, euen when he was ſet in the midſt of all perfection, aboue all baſe obiects.</p>

                  <hi>Q. But how could this be, he beeing Gods Image?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. He was actually ſo, but not vnchangeably. Therefore hauing his will left in her-freedome, &amp; vneſtabliſht by gracious determining thereof to good: Lo, when a ſenſible obiect is preſented by the Deuill, firſt ſhe (as the weaker) then he by her meanes, freely choſe to leaue God, and to embrace the creature. And hereby, when hee was made able if hee would, to ſtand, although ſo, as hee might fall, he turned this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary might, into a neceſſity of falling, and an impoſſiblenes of returne by himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. How lay ye forth this ſinne, more fully?</hi>

So yet looke what we come ſhort of <hi>Adam</hi> in the meaſure of grace in this life, wee go beyond him in the vnchangeableneſſe: for alas! how little are we fit to be truſted with all, but we would lauiſh it, if vnder our owne keeping? The Lord is fayne to humble vs rather vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of our infirmities and corruptions, becauſe we are not heere capable of any great matter. Being ſo vnfaithfull in the ſmaller, who ſhould truſt vs with the great treaſure? Laſtly, it teaches vs to eſteeme highly of the grace of ſelf-deniall, as beeing the contrary grace to <hi>Adams</hi> corruption. For he fell by too much truſting himſelfe: wee ſtand by the grace of ſelfe-renouncing. And its not amiſſe to conſider, how iuſtly the greateſt penalty of man ſtands in the loſſe of his freewill, and in the ſlauery of the will to ſinne: becauſe this freedome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed, cauſed his ruine.

               <p>Q. <hi>But in what order is this maſſe of euill deryued to vs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. In this: That firſt the actuall ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> eating the forbidden fruit, is conueyed and made ouer to vs: then originall, then actuall, then penalties, all han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging each vpon other as the leſſer boates tyed to the great ſhip.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177956:23"/> Becauſe the ſinne which <hi>Adam</hi> committed ere hee had be gotten a ſonne or childe, was the ſinne of nature, not of a Perſon. As it is ſayde, <hi>Leui himſelfe payde tithes in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.9.</note> ſo wee in <hi>Adam:</hi> hee to GOD, wee to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And that by the iuſtice of GOD: who, as hee would moſt iuſtly haue imputed the integrity of <hi>Adam</hi> to vs, if hee had ſtood therein, ſo might impute his ſinne. Wee were all in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, for better or for worſe. And as it was in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord did impute our ſins to him, who yet neuer ſinned after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ours, againſt a law: becauſe hee looked at him in the nature hee ſuſtained: ſo hee doth impute <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to vs, although wee in perſon ſinned not, becauſe wee ſinned in his nature. And as our Lord Ieſus had beene wronged, if he had ſuffred for that ſinne which was none of his [and wee alſo were farre from Redemption, if righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe could not bee really ſettled vpon vs by imputation] ſo except <hi>Adams</hi> ſin were firſt made ours by imputation, wee ſhould bee wronged in ſuſtayning the penalties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Imputation, I grant, differs in the manner and forme of it, being in Chriſt, onely by Gods account, in vs inherent: but ſtill reall in both (reſpects duely obſerued.)

Theſe Articles ſerue to plucke out, each of them one or other, and all of them, all thoſe falſe crootches and props which corrupt ſelf-holds vpon, to keep her from catching this deadly fall vnder her miſery. If there bee any evaſion for fleſh and blood, any ſtarting hole to get out at, ſhee will bee ſure to find it. This is the laſt ſtoppe of all: which ſhould quite ſinke the proud

               <p>To all the former, this one of vtter irrecouerableneſſe, and deſperate impoſſibleneſſe to get out, ſhould euen kill the hopes of a wretched heart, and burſt the belly of it. Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe miſery ſhould make an helpleſſe ſoule, lying panting at the mercy of a Sauiour, and gaſping for breath, that if there bee no more for her, out of her ſelfe, then within her, ſhee may giue ouer all. And while ſhee ſees no hope in her ſelfe, ſhee may deſpaire in her ſelfe. Till this laſt Lecture be read and beleeued by the ſoule, in vaine is Chriſt offred to her; while ſhe hath a wing of her owne, to fly ouer him with neglect.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that come to Chriſt, muſt bee wholly beaten out of all holds, and thoſe ſtrong holdes of ſelfe-hopes and ſelf-loues, either of nature meere, or mixt with ſome helpe ſupernaturall: Chriſt will neuer bee ſought to; if any other can bee deuiſed. <hi>Sleidan</hi> reports, that when ſome ſouldiers were ſurprized in their Caſtle, and all throwne downe from the top of it to bee daſht in pieces: one of them (among the reſt) falling through the bowes of a mulbery tree, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon with both Armes, ſtuck by it and ſaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from death. Wee may conceaue hee was loth to dye. Much more are wee! From the top of the firſt Article of this firſt Part, to this laſt and loweſt ſtayre, the Lord throwes downe the ſoule of a ſinner, to kill his ſpirit, and humble him: but ſo long as the leaſt crootch laſts, the ſoule that loues her owne corrupt life, abhorres to bee killed.</p>
               <p>But in Gods feare let this put an end to all fancies, and corrupt conceits of fleſh: and let it bring the ſoule to the earth, and caſt downe euery high thing and ſtrong hold, which ſets vp it ſelfe againſt the need of a Chriſt, and the neceſſity of faith. Giue vp now all weapons, and ſay, If it bee thus, Lord, thou haſt ouercome! I am bereft of all, and I muſt ſtand to the mercy of a Conqueror! I haue nothing to merit or help mee: it remaines now that vtter miſery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke

               <p>To conclude, put caſe the Angels ſhould mediate for vs, yea if a man were for his owne part as free of ſin as <hi>Adam,</hi> yet for that which is paſt, the offence of an infinite Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, he could not ſay any thing to it, it is a matter of higher nature.</p>

It ſhould greatly abaſe vs that wee are thus hurt, and know not how: much leſſe how to outgrow it. This vſe our age greatly needeth; wherein formality is ready to blot out the impreſſion of all truths of this kind, and nouzle it ſelfe in an eaſie religion, void of power. Secondly, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what a myſtery grace is. It is true which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, which Chriſt manifeſted.</hi> When Chriſt came and brought light foure thouſand yeeres after the Creation, it was as ſtrange as at firſt. And now when grace findes any man, how doth it preuent him? euen as the light comes vpon the drunkard in the depth of his ſnorting and ſurfet. Oh, the ſweet peace the ſinner findes in his miſery! As Iſrael made their bondage an eaſe: ſo wee hell it ſelfe our Heauen by cuſtome. Wee adde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to our blindneſſe and ſenſleſneſſe, by falſe errours of our owne and others. Wee ſleepe as <hi>Peter, betweene foure quaternions of our keepers,</hi> Deuill, Sinne, Law and Wrath. The Prouerbe is verified, The life of an idiot, is the ſweeteſt of all, for hee hath nothing to trouble him. So
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177956:27"/> heere, the life of a man dead in ſinne is, not to bee aware of it, pinch, burne, wound him, its nothing to him; threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, allure, all is one, preach terror or hope, woe or weale, hee is dead. The Law, curſe, Chriſt and grace, hope of Heauen are indifferent. Nay ſuch a fearefull offence is the Word to a dead ſinner, that euen that which ſhould occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conuincement and feare, works confidence in him: the Iewes tooke the Law (a killing letter) to bee the way and obiect of iuſtification.

For the firſt, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſorts of ſinners, ſo doth the Law take away their lets of knowledge. Take three or fore Inſtances. Put caſe CHRIST had purpozed to enlighten a Phariſe in the knowledge of ſinne, he would haue remmooued all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Law, and darknes of the text. They had eſtabliſht a Corban, which might free a child from the

They had curtolled the law in point of her extent, confining her to ſome groſſe crimes, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the key of light from the people about particulars, They had ſet vp an expoſition of their owne inuention: they had made what they liſted to bee ſinne, and what they pleaſed to be none: they had ſoothed the people vp in this courſe, and ſowed pillows vnder their elbowes, thinking the law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them to obey, and not to enlighten or conuince o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, come lower, to thoſe that liue in the Church of GOD, many are ignorant, by meere want of meanes, as thouſands of Congregations at this day are, though baptized. I remember the ſpeech of a Reuerend man, that once on the Sabbath, lighting vpon a Company (as hee was going to preach neere-by) who were ſome at foot-ball, ſome dancing the Morris, others quaffing in the Ale houſe, asked them, Sirs, why doe yee thus prophane the Sabbath? They anſwered him, Alas good Sir, wee know not that wee doe ill in our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or drinking: which drew teares from his eyes. If then GOD meane to enlighten ſuch, hee will giue them a Miniſtery of light, to teach them what is good and what is euill. So to come further, put caſe a third ſoft hath ſome kind of light, yet ſtill mainteining a ciuill, prophane, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall courſe, what will the Lord doe to enlarge them with cleere knowledge?

               <p>Firſt, The Law doth preſent the ſoule with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of GOD in commanding, and ſets vp her ſelfe, not in the ſences or back parts of man, but in his conſcience, the moſt priuy chamber of the ſoule. This no law of man can doe. No, nor can any deſtitute of the law, be truely ſeazed in conſcience
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177956:31"/> by any ſinne. But the Law ſets vp the Lawgiuer in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, preſenting him to her in all his Souereigne Iuſtice, wiſedome, and Power, that ſo, ſhe may eſteeme of ſin, not as touching man, but trenching vpon God in all his attributes. This is a great diſcouery, and cauſes ſin to bee conceaued as it is, not as the paſſing act ſeemes, which begins and ceaſes with time, but this is infinite in time, merit, extent, and ſcope, becauſe againſt an infinite God. For example. An igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man hauing hurt his neighbour, lookes at the ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the fact onely, how hee hath hurt him in his name, cattell, wife, goods, and ſo the damage is the ſin to him. But the enlightned conſcience lookes at the Lawgiuer: knowing that not man, but God hath made the Law againſt hurting man: man is the next, but God is the chief and laſt obiect of his ſinne. And therefore God muſt bee agreed with, or elſe conſcience will keep it vpon Gods record to appeare in due time. And, put caſe man would be appeaſed, yea is ſatisfied, yea, perhaps mans Law is ſatisfied by the death of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, yet GOD ſtill muſt be compounded with, as chiefly offended.</p>

S. <hi>Iames</hi> cleeres this, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Hee that breakes one, is culpable of all.</hi> Meaning, that ſuch is the chayn of the law, and ſo are the words couched together, that being by one and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ordained, he that brakes one, violates all: as he that breaks any linke of a golden chaine, breakes the coherence. Men thinke otherwiſe: But as hee who breakes his neighbours fence, treſpaſſes him aſwel as if he ranged all ouer his ground, becauſe the bond is broken: ſo heere. It were ſtrange to tell a drunkard, he broke more then the ſeuenth Commandement. But to tell him that he had broken all (as indeed he hath) were ſtrange to him. Not perhaps in actuall deed: but yet in power and effect, becauſe he hath broken the bond of that God who hath made all the reſt. And yet there is a further thing in it then ſo: for in a ſort, ſome actuall ſinne breakes all. As one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177956:31"/> hath deſcribed it in couetouſneſſe, ſo might I doe it in drunkenneſſe. For what drunkard makes not his cup, and companions, an Idoll? what cares he for Gods worſhip, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bee drunke in an Ale-houſe, within the ſound of the Preacher? What conuerſation toward man looks hee at in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, neighborhood, oathes, vowes to God or men? What Sabbaths doth he not breake? What parents and Magiſtrates doth he care for? but rather vndoes the eſtate of the one, and contemnes the cenſure of the other? What cares hee in his cups to breake the head of, yea, to ſtabbe his fellow? What vncleanneſſe and baſtardy is hee not guilty of? What booty by the high way will he balke, and perhaps with bloodſhed, to get money to drinke? What lyes and ſlanders? what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and ſhifts to defend his villanies and couer his ſin, will he forbeare? This is meet to thinke of, to open the harmony of a law. But howeuer this bee, ſure it is there is no ſinner, not onely groſſe; but euen ſecret, who is not guilty of all the Law in the breach of any Commandement, becauſe his vndue carriage fights againſt the Lord of the whole Law. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of this light might bee as much as ſome mens ſoules are worth: for what is the ſpeech of men?

               <p>Q. <hi>How fiftly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Law reaches forth to the ſoule her key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the poynt of her extent. She who hath her Ladyes keyes, knowes all, and can fetch out of ech boxe. So cannot the poor droile in the kitchin. So, this is the priuiledge of one that hath the Law to be hers. It is a great piece of the light of the Law, to extend it ſelfe in the ſoule to al parts and degrees of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in poynt of Spiritualnes of the Law: teaching vs not to reſt onely in open, groſſe, morall offences, but to goe to ſpirituall wickedneſſes. The Law is ſpiritually morall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as externally. Thus <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The Law is holy and good,</hi> I <hi>ſold vnder ſinne. And</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The end of the Commandement is loue out of a pure heart, good Conſcience, and fayth vnfeined.</hi> Then it muſt be very ſpirituall: and aſwell meet with infidelity, hypocriſy, vnthankfulnes, impiouſnes, profaneneſſe of ſpirit, ſecurity, hardnes of heart, contempt of Word &amp; Sabbaths, &amp;c. as open leudnes of life, riot, ſtealth, or adultery. And ſo alſo it enlarges the chiefe breach of a Law to all leſſer degrees and ſteps to it. As the ſeuench commandement reaches not onely to groſſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinenty: but to intemperancy, drunkennes, riot, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of ſences, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, her Inquiſition and Search: For the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. is very <hi>ſearching</hi> and piercing, <hi>diuides betweene the ioynts and marrow,</hi> dare and can go to any part of the whole man, and fetch out any poizon out of any corner; hath an vnlimited Commiſſion from the Law-giuer, to fetch out and bind any malefactor: not onely ſeene and manifeſt words and deeds, but alſo, the moſt retyred and cloſe thoughts and intents of the heart: the Power of GOD is with his Law to ſearch for the King, all vaults and dungeons, and nothing is hidden to the eye, no more then the earth to the Sun. Sinnes of great conſequent euils, or leſſe ſmall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177956:33"/> ſinnes, in mens eſteeme, and great, ſtill, and crying; hidden from man, and open to his view: granted, or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: carrying color or condemned by the world; Old ones, or new: in a word, The Law inquires vpon ſinne, according to the Anomaly of it, not onely the circumſtances. And this was our Sauiours chiefeſcope in that holy Sermon, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.6, 7. Chapters, correcting thoſe baſe limitations of the Law which the Phariſes made, tying men onely to a groſſe literall ſence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in her aggrauating power: whereby ſhe enlarges ſinne by her Circumſtances, cauſing it thereby to ſeeme the more odious, and ſetting the worſe colours vpon it; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a perſon committed it, a publique man, againſt ſuch light, when he needed not, from meere malignity of ſpirit, in the midſt of bleſſings, againſt mercy, Goſpell, vowes, couenant, &amp;c. which I do not ſpeake, as if all ſinnes were alike, but becauſe all are ſins and culpable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in her Purity. The Law doth not go to tell the ſoule of each ſin: but ſets the Mirror of Gods pureneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, that ſhe may according thereto, diſcerne and iudge of ſin: good and bad, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue and euill. Truth (wee ſay) is a Rule of her ſelfe and her contraries. There is a ſecret pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Law, whereby the ſoule diſcernes an euill in things which the world ſees none in: and againe, ſees none in ſome, wherein an hypocrite ſees much. For the former, A ſoule that hath cleer and thorow light in himſelfe, is a Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in ſome things of ſpecialty, and accuſes it ſelfe for the departing from the pure manner, ends, ground, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which GOD requires: as ſometime in the keeping of Sabbath, in vſe of liberties, in ſpeech or ſilence, in doing or abſtayning hath a Law within him: not ſo much what this morall precept bids or forbids, as, what the pureneſſe of it imports. So that looke, what ſorts moſt with will, fleſh, caſe or the inclination of nature, ſhe ſuſpects: yea euen in doubtfull caſes, yet withdrawes (for ſafety) rather then ventures vpon termes of her owne, abhorres appearances, as well as ſubſtance of euill. And as in matters of God, ſo in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177956:33"/> of men, this Pureneſſe Rules the caſe, when perhaps no Law is at hand, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Finally brethren, whatſoeuer is Holy, whatſoeuer pure, honeſt, of good report &amp;c.</hi> An heart enlightned can better iudge by this Rule then any thing, &amp; ſooner eſpies what is honeſt, ſauoury, then any other can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee can vſe theſe helpes, or perhaps the ſight of originall ſinne, to abaſe a wretched heart with, greater light or leſſe may ſerue him, as hee pleaſeth. But the truer the light, the ſounder the Conuiction. The Lord doth in this caſe, as the ſtate of the ſoule beſt admits ſometimes keeps away exceeding light in all theſe, leſt the ſule ſhould lye oppreſt vnder her burden: culling out ſome ſinne with due circumſtances of vileneſſe and ſhame, to bring the ſoule vpon her knees in a moſt kindly manner. Hee nis or bound heerein.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Law preſent the Penalties, with light to the ſoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To adde ſo much here, as may make vp that of the third Article: this I ſay, That the Lord ſhewes the like power, authority, and efficacy of light in theſe as the other: He takes away all diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of veniall &amp; mortall from a man: preſents himſelfe to him in his full iuſtice of reuenging al ſin without exception: remoues all cauills and ſubtill extenuations of puniſhment aſwell as of ſin; makes all ſin appeare mortall to the ſoule without Chriſt, &amp; veniall with him. Tells the ſoule, Deferring of puniſhment is no remoouall of it: <hi>That ſome ſins go before, ſome follow after,</hi> but all meet earlyer or later <hi>in iudgement, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1, 2. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. That all ſinnes deſerue all puniſhments. That the leaſt coſt the Lord Ieſus his blood, and he that beleeues it not, ſhall pay for it in hell: That God doth indifferently hate and puniſh all: Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh is to ech ſoule that ſinneth: <hi>Curſed is euery one:</hi> There is no lying hid from Gods eye: no ſhift, or euaſion beſides fayth and Repentance; No amity or Combination of ſinners, no ioyning hand in hand, no counſel can preuaile againſt God, who hath all penalties and executions in his hand to worke by. That the Court of God is not as the Popes: no Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Commutations of penance, Diſpenſations to bee had there: That the hauing our hell heere, is no Releaſe or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for heereafter: but, if wee haue not had heere, wee ſhall there haue all: if we haue had heere, we ſhall there haue the full ſumme of puniſhment, without Chriſt. And by this the Lord prepares the ſinner for conuiction, following in a <hi>far deeper</hi> meaſure, as in the point of terror ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Lord reueale originall ſinne to the ſoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To adde a little of this alſo to the third Article, the Lord doth this many wayes. Firſt, by the ſpeciall termes of his Word: Secondly, by compariſon of actuall ſins. Thirdly, by the properties of this originall.</p>

               <p>Q. <hi>Proceed to the third, How doth the Law preſent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of originall ſin to the ſoule?</hi>

That wherein a quality is firſt, that is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently worſt. As coldneſſe in the earth, dryneſſe in fire, heate in the ayre, and moyſture in the water. So when a Iudge is vniuſt, in the place of equity, hee is eminently vniuſt. Euen ſo heere. All ill qualities are firſt planted heere: and its ſinne in the Spirit, in the place of excellency, euen of Gods Image. That whereby another thing is qualified ſo or ſo, that it ſelfe is much more ſo qualified. As we ſay, Thoſe wofull, deſperate Traytors in Gun-powder treaſon, were ſo and ſo deſperate, rebellious, cruell, fierce: but by whom were they made ſo? by their father <hi>Garnet</hi> and grandfather the Pope: <hi>Garnet</hi> and the Pope then muſt be much more ſo.

               <p>Fourthly, Its an ouerflowing, and yet a cruell euill (as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as it is, &amp; as forcible.)

               <p>Fifthly, The Bondage of it. It bindes vp the ſoule in death, hardneſſe, inſenſibleneſſe, incapableneſſe of any good, auerſeneſſe to all meanes of Grace.

And there is nothing more perilous then this, to dally with ſinne vnder pretext of religion and zeale, when yet the heart is vtterly loth to take the point of this knife into it.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>How doth the Miniſtery of the Law grapple with theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By iogging the ſoule, and not ſuffring her to be any of theſe, but being more forcible in ſetting the Word home to the ſoule, and breaking open that locke which will not ſhoote of her ſelfe. Some view of this briefly I will giue to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo come to the vſe. Thus then: the Lord doth ayme at this (where he will conuince) not to ſuffer the ſoule to lye in her halfe conuincings, but beats her off from all her ſubtill ſhifts, waſhes off her Colours, and puts her to ſilence, that ſhe hath no more to gaineſay: and this hee doth many waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By entring into a ſolemne iudiciall courſe with the ſoule, and applying the light to her by particular eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence giuing in againſt her, that ſhee is this childe of death. Take an example. While the Thiefe heares the Iudge giue his charge to the Country, and enlighten the Country in the Law of the Land, hee giues way to all, but is no whit troubled, becauſe its not brought home to himſelfe, but in generall ſpoken againſt all theeues, murtherers, &amp;c. But when the ſayle is deliuered, this Thiefe called and examined, how then? will his pleading not guilty, ſerue the turne? No. The Iudge calles the witneſſe, reades the confeſſion, ſends out the Iury, who bring in a verdict againſt him. And how then? Oh! then he is conuinced and cannot deny, but grants, I ſtole it, my Lord, I brake the houſe, I ſhed blood. Thus the Lord deales heere: will not let the ſinner alone, but dogs him with his light: doſt not remember the time, the place the odiouſneſſe of ſuch a

Not of the wrath of a man againſt a man, but of God againſt a ſinner; not able to kill the body, but to caſt body and ſoule into hell.

When thou art angry for ſin, man is made as a garment moth-eaten! The Lord Ieſus himſelfe could not eſcape it, <hi>his ſoule was heauy to death, he ſweet drops of blood, he thought God quite gone from him!</hi> And yet this (at the worſt) is better then any other of the three I ſpake of. And this we haue ſeene and daily do in men (in ſpite of theſe hardned times) the Lord breakes in vpon ſome, and makes the ſins of youth and age before them: Oh, that we could ſee the fruit of it after! To this I adde, The Lord doth this more or leſſe in the ſoule. I purpoſely ſay ſo, becauſe God is not tied in his courſe to any ſet meaſure, hee can reſtraine or enlarge as hee pleaſeth. Many vnder a good Miniſtry or teaching, hauing little felt this way of God, doubt of their humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but if they can prooue that the Lord hath hidden the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of terror by long &amp; frequent trayning, that heere &amp; there the Lord hath reuealed himſelfe more or leſſe to them, with fruit to be deſired, let it not trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. More vſually the Lord deales thus with ſoked ſinners, that they might vomit the morſels which they haue long taken in: that by this courſe, their change might be more apparant, and for euer theſe markes of God might abide in their fleſh to awe and bridle them; yet I ſay, God is not tyed: I haue noted greater terrors in the choiſeſt educations (as the caſe hath ſtood) then in openeſt Profaneneſſe.</p>

                  </gap> that effect of Prouidence, whereby the Lord doth limit the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and meaſure of ſin in the wicked, for the preſeruation of peace ande ciuill ſociety: for though that be a diuine work, yet its not the immediate worke of the law: but either a Prouidence without a word, or elſe by the generall power of the Word reſtraining ſin: but this is a ſpeciall kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, iſſuing from the work of the Law, for the good of the ſoule ſo reſtrained. And it is a lothſomnes of the ſoule, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ioy in old courſes, beholding them with repenting and yrking of thoughts, wiſhing them vndone, and abhorring to returne to them through the terror of conſcience, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this whip of the Law. When horror lay vpon <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9. his letters in his pocket, and commiſſion from the Prieſts, and trade it ſelf of purſiuantſhip was bitter: no more of that for the preſent. As the ague ſtirring the diſeaſed humors, makes that ſtomack loath a Partridge, which before could haue eaten reſty bacon: ſo heer, this terror makes the ſweeteſt ſin lothed, which before deuoured all. And although this be not grace, yet the Lord is laying a beginning therof, heerby in the ſoule, which in due ſeaſon may come to ſomewhat. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a pretty ſpeech of an Heathen in one of his Epiſtles: who being ſicke, dare do as while he is well? who then guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles, or is vncleane, or railes, or is couetous? That is much truer of this ſoule ſickneſſe; in which the ſtomack hath more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177956:47"/> liſt to vomit, then to eate! Now the reaſon of this worke is, becauſe while the ſoule is in her hurry, ſhee hath no care to heare God ſpeaking to her: ſhe is ſo buſie with her trade, that all is ſpoken as it were in her caſt. Beſides, the Lord lothes to worke vpon a ſoule, in the heat of her luſt: firſt he will frame her to his diſcipline, ere he beſtow any grace vpon her. And rarely doth the Lord honor any bold reuolting ſinner, during his courſe, till firſt he haue ſtopt him ſome time from it. So then, terror firſt turnes edge, and gets within and ouergoes a ſinner in his way: as <hi>Zara</hi> ouertakes <hi>Phares</hi> in his haſty iſſue out of the wombe. The vſe briefly (that ſo I may be ſhort in the maine vſe when I come to it) is, firſt, not to imagine all reſtraints from euill to be grace; try them firſt: God intends them for good, but they are as farre from mortification, as a trembling or Lyon-couchant is from a dead one: The vileſt harlot (that <hi>Roſamund</hi> in her vault) was actually kept from her vncleanneſſe as well as chaſt matrones: but her heart was as before, her principle was vncleane ſtill. Not the loue of good, but lothing of euill reſtraines legally. For the time <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was ſo far from his pieces, that hee chuzes to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather then to fall to his trade. And therefore reſtraint onely is not to be reſted in: howbeit God, where he meanes to proceed ſauingly, doth reſtraine wholeſomely, if we could iudge: but ſeeing this is a ſecret, truſt not our ſelues or others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heerein, till the Lord hath by this ſtep trained vs further. Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioice for the leaſt degree (as I confeſſe in ſuch a looſe debaucht age reſtraint of ſome yong drunkards would ſeeme high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) its better to haue the halfe loafe, then no bread: but follow the Lord, in the ſauor of his law, to a ſetting a true principle of pureneſſe and grace, and loue, to renue &amp; change thee,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.9</note> and to forſake ſin with a true, abhorring, as hell.</p>

If conuiction aſſault, yet holding it off with obſtinate error or profaneneſſe, and colouring with halfe yeelding: and ſhew of conſent, the heart being rotten. The Law of God fights againſt all theſe, (hauing once the ſoule vpon the hip &amp; vantage of terror) &amp; doth cleare the deluded bribed iudgement, ſtabbes the heart for her long rottenneſſe and reſt in it, rends off and ſweepes down with the hand and beſome of the law, all the paper walles and copweb deuices ſhe had ſpun; and vtters it ſelfe both to her ſelfe &amp; others, in deep deteſtation againſt the. All that league of a rotten heart with ſin, ſelf, hell &amp; danger, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.18. the Lord batters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hard ſtones of terror, that it may be daſht in pieces. And ſo for the time it holds (except the ſoule ſhake it off) &amp; therfore at the worſt is infinitely better then all old peace. A iuſt warre is to bee preferred to vniuſt peace alway: and the hardeſt day of terror to a mans conſcience for all his old rex, is better then the ſweeteſt he euer had in euill and the pleaſures of it. Oh, his companions, his excuſes, colours and deceits are reuealed to be helliſh! the curtaine now is opened, and he ſees them all meer Paint of an harlot to keep him in a ſpirituall fornication. Hee is now ſo farre from peace, that he ſees hell gaping vpon him to deuoure him for his ſweet pleaſures! Let the vſe be treble.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Iudge thy ſelfe, if thou be not yet come thus far, that thy falſe peace is broken off by the law, thou art in wofull caſe &amp; the man thou wert wont.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177956:48"/> which ten times might be better ſpent in bringing ye out of conceit with your ſelues, and abhorring your rotten league, that ſo the Lord might begin to thinke well of ye? But men cannot abide to be thought ill of: what doe ye thinke amiſſe of them? Euen as the life of banquerouts is, to ſet a good face on it, and borrow what they can get and brace it out with their wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and go braue in apparell, till ruine come; ſo heer, men occupy with a ſtock that is none of theirs, and yet ſcorn to haue their ſtates ſuſpected, but are as good as the beſt of all others! Oh, falſe peace will bring ye to ruine at laſt! That ye would catch at, ye ſhall neuer get: but that ye do ſo ſhun, ye ſhall for euer meet with; vtter ſhame with God and men, and deſtruction to your ſelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Labor for this worke of the law, to pull ye down and bewray your falſe peace: try your ſelues by this, that now yee cry out of all dawbers with vntempered morter, falſe prophets, and preachers of peace, together with that Arch-falſe prophet of ſelf-loue; and cling to the faithfull, and count their wounds Balme: as for your owne vainties, they haue cauſed ye to forſake mercy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let not this be enough that yee are brought thus far; till Chriſt haue wholly <hi>expelled that ſtrong man,</hi> who rules and lockes vp the houſe in peace, and till he bring in a true bottome of peace into yee, by ſprinkling ye with his blood <hi>that ſpeakes better things then that of Abel.</hi> When this Sherif comes, he will fetch out all dwellers in the houſe, and breake open all: happy are they to whom the law brings this writ of eiection, eſpecially if the other Sherif of the Goſpel bring in a new and a ſound peace.</p>

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:177956:48"/>
               <p>The Lord ayming by this to hold and keepe the ſoule who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will ſaue, from all reuolt to former luſt &amp; liberties. The ſpirit of bondage is the frame of a fearfull heart, held vnder ſlauery and chaynes of the Law, from all eſcaping. As we ſay, ſuch a man hath the ſpirit of mirth, or Couetouſnes in which he is rooted. So in one place a woman is ſayd to haue a ſpirit of infirmity, <hi>viz.</hi> Sealth, when her diſeaſe had ſo preuayled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat cannot get out. It might bee wondred at, that the Lord ſhould vſe ſuch a courſe to do the ſoule good: but conſidering our curſed baſe heart (which is like the ſlaue, no longer to bee in worke, then the whip is vpon the backe:) it is no marueile. Take a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Wee know it is one thing to bee rankt in the forlorne band which goes againſt the Cannon mouth: another to bee beleaguered in a City by a long ſiege. The one looke at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger, which when its ouer, they are paſt it: but in the City men are held vnder continuall feare: they ſee the Image of Death before their face ten wayes; by famine, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Sword: heere one wall beaten downe, there another; heere one ſlayne, there another; ſome dye of famine, and threaten the reſt to follow: ſo heere: to be vnder bondage, is to lye vnder chaines as <hi>Peter</hi> vnder many keepers: by which meanes, frequent terrors aſſault dayly more or leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>: and the ſoule is held to it, as poore Iſrael vnder bricke and clay. Neuer was this Taskemaſter of more vſe then in theſe dayes: wherein men ſhunne legall feares, as Todes or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, or if any come nigh them, they ſhake it off with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Its yrkeſom to the fleſh to bee vnder the whip long: ſome way of breaking out of this houſe of Correction they deuiſe, thinking themſelues neuer well, till they be at their old liberty out of the hands of ſo hard a Maſter. But as it is with the breaker of the houſe of Correction or priſon, his end is commonly to be hanged: ſo is it with ſuch as deſpize this remedy of a licentious heart.</p>
               <p>Now for vſe of it; beware that wee reſt not in this feruill ſtate. Whatſoeuer the LORD meanes to do by it in time,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177956:49"/> when hee offers the Goſpell to the ſoule, ſure it is, this is no ſtate to reſt in. For why? It differs from true feare as much as from true liberty. True feare, is the Lodeſtone to attract the ſoule to GOD, and to acquaint it with GOD; thus rather (of it ſelfe) dryues it away from God, eſpecially if it bee in any exceſſe. Secondly, This feare hath a reſpect to ſinne onely as an occaſion, to puniſhment as a cauſe. As wee ſee in the Slaue who lookes not at his Sloth, but the whip. But the true filiall feare looks at ſinne as the proper cauſe of feare, but at puniſhment as the occaſion. Thirdly, True feare ſoftens: this rather hardens and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the heart: As wee ſee both in the examples of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> who melted: and <hi>Ahab,</hi> who hardend his heart by his feare, and returned to his pranks. The feare of a condemned man is an hardner of him, but he that heares of a pardon, relents at it preſently. Fourthly, It hath exceſſe in it, both for the conſtant aſſault of it without intermiſſion, in all places, dutyes, and occaſions: and alſo for the dangerous inconuenience it brings after it oft times: Hinders all fitnes of ſpirit both to duty, and in duty, to calling, worſhip, liberty, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarines, defiles all, and is a ſpeciall ſparke to light vpon the ſad and melancholique temper of the body, (which the Deuill ſeldome fayles in) to make it flaſh vp and blow vp the whole frame of nature! yea euen in the godly themſelues its a mayne enemy to fayth, hope, or other graces or duties. Fifthly, And the truth is, looke how the feare of her that played the harlot, differs from the loyall wifes, ſo doth this from the feare of the regenerate: the one feares danger and hurt from her husband; the other reuerences him from loue. <hi>Saul</hi> feared <hi>Dauid,</hi> becauſe he lookt for danger from him, no otherwiſe. Let the vſe then I ſay, be, to take heed leſt we reſt in it.</p>

               <p>One this, when the ſinner waxes bold and ventrous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to ſhake off this yoke of the Law, before his ſpirit be conuinced and caſt downe.

Thus <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite growes to thinke <hi>God to be like himſelfe.</hi> This ſinne made <hi>Adam,</hi> and all vs curſed, preſumption againſt threats. Oh, when wee thus fall to our old trade, the Deuill falls to his, &amp; <hi>finding the ſoule thus ſwept, returnes with ſeuen worſe then himſelfe.</hi> Let vs tremble at it, and learne to inure our ſelues to heare all threats with feare. Learne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this doctrine, which I haue at large deſcribed. I ſpeake not now of ſauing faith, but againſt preſumptuous boldneſſe againſt the Law. To credit the Word to be Gods, who cannot lye, may fall into a ſupernaturall conuiction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not yet ſauing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond preſumption is, When the conſternation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Law, ceazing without the addition of the Goſpell, cauſes the ſoule to waxe confident of it owne welfare, becauſe it hath beene humbled, and perhaps holds ſome impreſſion of it ſtill, not daring to reſiſt her light. But
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:177956:51"/> this is rare, and dangerous: for its a ſigne that the heart is ſecretly falſe and vnpurged: Reſt in no checkes of conſcience, where conſcience her ſelfe is not firſt purged, both to check, and alſo to excuſe and comfort the ſoule in the Satiſfaction of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is Deſperation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The other contrary, offending as much on the left hand, through the exceſſe of terror. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> And it commonly growes from the firſt: Satan neuer ſeeking more to poizon with preſumption, and dallyance with the Law, then where he meanes to ſnare with the contrary of deſpaire. How oft was <hi>Saul</hi> conuinced of his malice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? But returinng to his vomit, brought ſoule and body to a deſperate end. So <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> by their hidious ſinnes brought themſelues to this, that mercy and Chriſt were not able to doe them good: their ſinnes were growne beyond forgiuenes! A wofull fruit of boldeneſſe! And yet iuſt: for he who will vndervalue grace in the worth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is iuſtly left to ouerualue ſinne in the merit of it. He that neuer can find ſeaſon to beleeue the Word beeing offred, is iuſtly left to ſeeke it with violence when the ſeaſon is ouer. And ſo, eyther its neuer time with them (as he ſpake of marriage) or elſe paſt time. Many compare theſe ſinnes with great adoe, but the wiſer way is to preuent both, and the latter in the former. Doubtles it is the ſinne of the damned, to liue in the perpetuall deſpaire of releaſe; and in perſwaſion that Grace is vnable to do them good. Let vs know, farre worſe ſinnes then theſe may deſtroy: let vs neuer preſume to venture, ſo farre as to dye by theſe.</p>

And ſo much be ſpoken of this point of Conſternation, and of the three acts of the Law, and the vſes in ſpeciall. There is one generall vſe to be added afterward.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Before wee adde the vſe of Terror in generall, one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection offers it ſelfe, viz, that Paul, Rom</hi> 7.7. <hi>ſayth</hi> When the Law came, ſinne reuiued: <hi>how then is Terror the worke of the Law? Paul doth in that place ſo affirme the former, that he denyeth not the latter, adding this,</hi> But I dyed: <hi>noting, that both might ſtand together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Both may be together in one vnregenerate man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to diuers parts. For when the Law had ſlaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>then concupiſcence reuiued.</hi> And wee muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene the naturall worke of the Law and the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall: Terror is the proper worke of it, and when its wrought, it is as it ought to be. But when rebellion ariſeth, its otherwiſe then ought to be. When the Sunne reuiueth and ſweetens the earth, it workes properly: when it drawes vp the noyſome ſtench of a dunghill to poizon the ayre, its accidentall, comming from the loathſomnes of the dunghill. So, when ſinne rebells, ſhe doth her kind: for ſhe doth as the deuill did when he went out, he foamd &amp; raged and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed firſt. It proceedes from the fulnes of the ſtomacke of ſin, loth and diſdayning to yeld to a new gueſt. But howeuer ſinne do her kind, yet if the Law do ſet her ſelfe to do hers, this rebellion ſhall not hinder the killing power of it: It ſhall rather encreaſe it: For when the ſoule comes to ſee, how
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177956:52"/> lothſome ſinne hath made her, that euen when the Law by her righteous good nature ſeeks to deſtroy ſinne, then ſhee moſt couets it, cleaues to it, and ruſhes her ſelfe vpon it to iuſtle it aſide: this makes her conclude her ſelfe out of meaſure wofull by ſinne, out of meaſure ſinfull. And when rebellion begins to bee tamed, the heart growes more and more vnder feare: Although nothing hinder why both may not at one time bee together. Onely in the bad, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it encreaſeth, till it haue caſt out all terrour, and ſo cauſes the ſoule to wax worſe for the Lawes enlightning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſweet of ſinne hath ſo preuailed, that with an high hand of rebellion it ſtrengthens the iollity of ſin, and ſo reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. In the godly, in whom God will vſe the Law as a ſeed of regeneration, and a way to a remedy, the Lord will enlarge terror and conuictions ſo farre, that rebellion ſhall not ſtand it out, but ſtoop with confuſion vnder the power of it. Its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein, many periſh at this ſecond rock of rebellion, hauing ſhot the gulfe of ignorance.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:177956:54"/> Second Penall, and the third, Mixt.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt kind is, when the Word or law comes ſo to the corrupt ſoule, that as yet it carries no power or authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſoule with it, but ſtill the ſoule holds her owne: for then, ſo cloſe is ſin and the ſoule, they ſo conſent, that to bee parted from their filthy fellowſhip, is death to them both, ſin incorporating herſelfe into the ſoule, that ſhe is as one with them, though in truth there is as great oddes between them, as betweene the creation of God, and the confuſion of the Deuill: howbeit ſo it is by their neerneſſe and Inmateſhip, the one ſo defiles another, that it is as eaſy for <hi>Samſon</hi> to part with his <hi>Delila,</hi> as for theſe to be ſundred. Heere therefore as both band in euill: ſo both do conſpire in rebellion againſt all the lawes of God; all his Knight-Marſhals, Conſtables, and Officers: its as eaſy to rob a beare of her whelpes, as theſe of their ſinfull pleaſures: and when any thing is done by the law againſt; Oh, what a liuery do they giue it, and Gods officer for it? Oh, he comes to make vproare and bring in confuſion among neighbours, that liued before at one, Oh! ſay they, its pity that euer ſuch were ſuffred, to breake the loue and liking that was before! Oh, how they combine to caſt him out, that they might roll backe to their old mire! the Miniſter is to ſuch as the Marſhall in London is to harlots! an ey-ſore, a reproch, and common wonderment! Their gaine, their ſweet trade, their ſhrines for <hi>Diana</hi> are ſtopped: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now they cry out more then euer, <hi>Great is Diana:</hi> their drinking, their luſts, pride and couetouſneſſe, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſweet to them, as now the oppoſition of the Word makes them. The good, and holy law of God, makes them worſe and worſe, they ruſh their crazy ſoules againſt the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Gods truth, and ſplit themſelues at it, and become more out of meaſure ſinfull.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt rebellion in the vnconuinced: the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common rebellion to be ſeene now a daies, where the Word comes powerfully vpon ignorant conſciences, ſnorting in profaneneſſe. This is not heere meant.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is Penall, a fruit of this, onely encreaſed by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177956:54"/> iuſt wrath of God vpon the former rebels: whoſe chaynes Lord makes ſtronger, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.22. by how much the more they kicke againſt the pricks: I ſay, when the Lord penally ſmites them, &amp; ſuffers them to encreaſe and fulfil the meaſure of their luſts, to grow frozen in theſe dregs, deſperate in their luſts: to ſcorne, purſue, deface the meanes, and waxe impenitent in their rebellion, ſo that they find no place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting. See theſe texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.32, 34, <hi>Act.</hi> 41.13. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.27, and the like: neither is this meant heere.</p>
               <p>The third is Mixt: When rebellion is allayed with terror <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of conſcience, and not permitted to her ſelfe: as we know a theefe in hold, is one thing: and at liberty, is another: Now this mixt terror is the accidentall worke of the law (in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted and troubled conſcience) working corruption to a rebellion and reſiſtance, that ſinne might bee odious, and the ſoule more humbled. So that by this appeares, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing or rebelling is no act of conſcience, or the ſoule: for its planted in another ſubiect to wit, ſin. Conſcience all this while is oppreſſed with thraldome by the law, and held downe: the rebellion which is, comes from the principle of luſt, which cannot endure ſeparation. To apply then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, I anſwere, This obiection hinders not this truth: That the proper work of the law, is to caſt downe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondage the guilty ſoule.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The chieft doubt remaining, is: How a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Conſcience priuy to much reuiuing of corruption, may diſcerne, that it commeth not from her ſelfe, but from ſinne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This may be diſcerned eaſily by many markes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the worke of the law that hath ſeparated her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from ſin, and that amity, which once was between her and it. This is no hard matter to prooue, if once the ſoule can ſay, her old luſts, and ſhe are diuided by the lawes of terror: How can ſhe then thinke that ſhe ſhould rebell againſt the good law, for working that which ſhe is glad of?</p>
               <p>Secondly, It will appeare by this, that rebellion muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> come from a free will and principle of the agent: but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177956:55"/> that cannot bee conſcience, nor her ſelfe, becauſe ſhee is conuinced by an ouerruling Law, which hath killed her freedome.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by this, that rebellion where it is vnconuinced, doth not onely fret in reſpect of ſomewhat ſhe is denied, but al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o at that which croſſeth her for it ſelfe. But in this legall rebellion, when the ſoule is in chaynes, the ſcope of this rage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s rather in reſpect of that which is denied, then at the Law ſimply as the Law. Take an inſtance. <hi>Act.</hi> 25.19. When <hi>Demetrius</hi> made an vprore againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> the Iewes alſo tooke occaſion to oppoſe him: but how? <hi>Demetrius</hi> looked at his gaines: and if hee might haue them, hee was quiet: he oppozed not <hi>Paul</hi> in his preaching. But the Iewes lookt at <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> a Preacher of Chriſt, and in no by-reſpect. So heere, when the conſcience lyes in chaynes and rebels not, ſinne hath loſt her agent: therefore ſhe onely lookes at her ſelfe, and at her trade: if ſhe might be as ſhee deſires, all were well. But when the ſoule and ſhe conſented, they both oppozed the Law, as the Law; not onely by a muttering within of ſecret ſelfeloue: Ponder this.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, try it by this, when rebellion comes from the ſoule, it encreaſes ordinarily: but when from ſinne, it decreaſes: becauſe the LORD more and more weakens her by terror of Conſcience. Theſe and the like may ſerue for anſwer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>New finiſh with ſome vſes what are they?</hi>

Though we preach all our daies againſt morall offences, drinking and the like, yet wee ſhall neuer doe good, if we vrge not the Law vpon theſe two, and put a ſeparation betweene GODS Creature, and the brood of Satan.</p>

When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was led to ſee thoſe Iewes in their priuy houſes of Idolls, Tammuz and the like, he was aſtoniſhed to ſee: Should not we be ſo if wee ſaw a blind idiot in his kind? He is alyue.

This is the crowne, the life, the iollity of a ſinner, to play his parts without rebuke, or remorſe. Eaſe, quiet, and ſecurity in euill, is Satans kingdome, both while hee can barre out all light of the Law from the ſoule: and when hee can barre out the ſoule from it.

And note, that this appeared not at firſt, yet it was there then, and appeared after. This is the cauſe, why GOD the Father is heere called <hi>our Sauiour,</hi> and why he is ſaid <hi>to Saue vs,</hi> in ver. 5. <hi>viz.</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.17. he is ſaid <hi>to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs:</hi> not by meriting it, but by firſt and originall ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it as the firſt agent in the working of the Trinity, the deuizer of this Saluation, and of the Lord Ieſus the meriter of it.

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt, is the impulſiue cauſe, ſet down by three words, <hi>Kindneſſe, Loue, Mercy.</hi> Whereof the latter interprets the former <hi>Kindneſſe and Loue,</hi> noting the remainder of that Goodneſſe of Creation, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The ſin of man could not root out this goodneſſe ſo, as to take it from God, but ſtill he had a bottomleſſe goodneſſe and kindneſſe left in himſelfe. But the third word <hi>(Mercy)</hi> add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to them both, q. d. The Lord imparted himſelfe to <hi>Adam,</hi> in this goodneſſe of his, ere hee was fallen, but hee ſhewd him no
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177956:63"/> mercy, for hee needed none. But beeing become miſerable; Lo, he addes mercy to goodnes, and enlarges his firſt kindnes and loue by a ſecond compaſſion &amp; pity, reſpecting him now in his blood and miſery, in which he exceeds the former as much as the Sun at noonetyde doth the rizing: mercy being the perfection of loue.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is from the deniall of contraries, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Not by workes of righteouſnes, &amp;c.</hi> The ſumme is, this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mercy was free in the conception of it. The LORD foreſaw not who ſhould in time embrace this mercy, nor left it in a middle doubtfull vncerteinty who ſhould and who not, ſuſpending his pleaſure vpon mans will, but he did out of the freedome of grace and mercy (when as yet no good in vs was foreſeene, much leſſe actuall) when no naturall or ſupernaturall goodnes was to bee ſeene in vs: euen then hee ſaued vs, becauſe he would ſo doe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond branch of this deſcription?</hi>

Now, in this point, note, firſt he ſayth, <hi>It appeared.</hi> As we ſee the like word Chapter ſecond verſe 11. The ſumme is, whereas it had bin impoſſible for man or Angel euer to haue diued into the depth of this mercy; Lo, the Lord cauſed it to appeare in the fulnes of time, and brake open this ſealed fountaine of his boſome, by the manifeſting thereof in his Sonne: for no man at <hi>any time hath ſeene the Father, but the onely begotten Sonne of GOD</hi> comming out of his boſome, <hi>hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> him.</p>
               <p>And which is this Appearer, who made mercy appeare in himſelfe? <hi>Ieſus Chriſt our Sauior.</hi> It muſt bee ſo, that howſoeuer mercy was hidde in the Father, yet it could not appeare but by Ieſus our Sauior: he truly God and man in obeying &amp; ſuffering, muſt bring iuſtice to kiſſe this mercy by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:177956:64"/> appeaſing that infinite anger of the Father for ſinne, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch a righteouſnes for man, as might afford: a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatiſfaction to GOD in his vttermoſt iuſtice: Chriſt, and none elſe could thus do or ſuffer, none elſe may ſatiſfy, he himſelfe without all this, both obedience and blood could not doe it: none of his loue, or prayers or pouerty, but Ieſus our Sauiour in this his full payment, as a ſurety and a Sacrifice of blood could, ſaue vs?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>All this is euident: but what elſe addeth the Apoſtle to make vs this deſcription of deliuerance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The third point is the obiect vpon whom this bleſſing is beſtowed, intimated in theſe words, <hi>Towards (man)</hi> and <hi>ſaue (vs)</hi> and <hi>ſhed on (vs), &amp;c.</hi> By which as he implieth that Man in his miſery, the ſelfe ſame man that fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God to hell, was the obiect of mercy: ſo, the Number of all thoſe to whom the Lord doth ſauingly appeare in this mercy of his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt are the ful obiect of mercy, &amp; al that mercy can beſtow. The Church of Chriſt is ſhe, who is the ſole and equall obiect of Chriſt: all he did and ſuffred, was, not for the reprobate,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> but the Elect: theſe he redeemed, <hi>gaue him ſelfe for, that he might make them a peculiar ſpouſe to himſelfe without ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> as he ſayth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in plainer termes?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>And what are thoſe excellent things which IESVS our Sauiour hath purchaſed? doth this Text mention them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, verie fully: and that both in generall &amp; ſpeciall. For the firſt, he ſayth he <hi>ſaued vs.</hi> Which is as if hee had ſayd, he reſtored and ſet vs in as good an eſtate as we loſt, and quit vs as fully of all our miſery, as euer old <hi>Adam</hi> did plunge vs into it. If hee loſt vs, Chriſt ſaued vs: if hee betrayd vs to bondage, He redeemed vs: if he brought vs to vtter hatred, He reconciled vs: if he condemned vs, Chriſt forgaue vs: hee did deliuer vs (in a word) from all ſinne and curſe, and layd a plaſter on vs, full as broad as the ſore.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> Yet this muſt bee added, that <hi>Not as the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is, ſo is the gift.</hi> For in <hi>Adam</hi> wee were ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:177956:64"/> made the Image of GOD, that we loſt it preſently: but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſo ſaued vs, pardoned and reconciled vs, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be loſt, neuer to bee curſed, neuer condemned the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</p>
               <p>And more yet, <hi>Adam</hi> was not created to any happineſſe ſaue immortality vpon earth, in a created righteouſneſſe: We to an vncreated Vnion and Communion with God in Heauen, in the preſence of God. This in generall. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the words heere are three, <hi>Saued vs, Regenerated vs, Renewed vs.</hi> By the firſt of them, vnderſtand the negatiue part of this deliuerance, <hi>viz.</hi> from what he freed vs: Sinne, Law, Satan, Wrath, Death, Iudgement. By the latter two, the poſitiue good things purchaſed vs. Firſt, by Regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Renewing, he meanes all thoſe graces, which concerne our eſtate in the grace of Iuſtification, ſtanding in ſomewhat cut of our ſelues, the imputation of the righteouſneſſe of our Lord Ieſus, remoouing our guilt, and beſtowing on vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, acceptance to fauour, and right to eternall life, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted heires thereof. And in this reſpect we are regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and borne again, by reconciliation. Secondly, by the eſtate of grace in ſomewhat within vs, which is the Inherency of that Image of Chriſt, infuzed into vs, and abiding in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſoule and body, and all the powers and faculties of both: purging out and killing old euils, and planting good anew in the ſtead thereof. In both theſe ſtands the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, renewed in Chriſt, to true righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in this World, and heereafter, to the glorious image of God in perfection. And this latter concerneth our Renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Doth the Text mention any more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, the inſtruments of applying theſe good things to vs: And that both outward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Outward, the Word and Sacraments. He nameth not the Word, but yet includeth it. For a ſeale is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a couenant. He meanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that by the word of truth, the Couenant of Grace, offring vs to be reconciled to God, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:177956:65"/> freely, generally, without exception (to ſuch as need it) to all ſorts, ages, ſexes, conditions, the Lord (as by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ordinance) doth apply and conuey theſe good things of Ieſus Chriſt to his elect. And then hauing ſo done, he ſealeth vp and aſſureth them, by the anſwerable ſeale of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>Then, the inward inſtrument of application, (without which the outward is barren) is the worke of the Spirit of regeneration, which attends the Word and Baptiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and waſheth the ſoule by the power thereof, euen the Spirit of Chriſt. To the which end, this Spirit doth ingender the grace of faith in the ſoule, for the apprehending of our part, in our particular Saluation and Regeneration: Which grace of faith, although it be not heere named, yet is implied ſufficiently in this worke of the Spirit. For there is no other way for the Spirit, to ſettle theſe benefits vpon vs, but faith onely, as in the Articles following ſhall appeare. And thus we ſee how the Apoſtle doth in this text moſt pithily contriue the chiefe heads of this Part, as in the Articles following appeares.</p>

                     <hi>A. That there is a Deliuerance,</hi> ordained and granted to miſerable man out of this his thraldome. As the matter of <hi>Adams</hi> creation lay before the Lord, at his free choiſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to create it, or not: ſo the obiect of Redemption (fallen man) lay at the Lords courtezie, whether or no he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him. If man had beene wholly left to himſelfe, his mends had beene in his owne hands. in all outward miſeries its otherwiſe: a man may be loſt in a forreſt and periſh: pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by enemies, aſſaulted by diſeaſes, oppreſſed by death, &amp; periſh, without help. Heere not ſo: miſery was the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from meriting, but not occaſioning mercy: the Lord freely out of meere mercy, beheld miſery, and when there
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:177956:65"/> was none to ſaue, he himſelfe did, yea, vſed this ruine as a meane of declaring himſelfe to man, the author of a farre more excellent eſtate then he loſt by his fall. And this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poze of God the Father to permit the fall, that he might worke his owne endes thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſetting forth of the riches and treaſure of his grace of election in Chriſt, by the meanes of calling and the Goſpell, is that which the Holy Ghoſt doth make the obiect of the admiration and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men and Angels: <hi>Who pry into this myſtery,</hi> as the Cherubins into the Mercy ſeate.</p>

                  <p>To ſtay the heart of a diſtreſſed wretch in the ſight of his miſery, by this light <hi>and dore of hope:</hi> Although farre from beleeuing it, yet by hope to ſuſtain it ſelfe by from vtter ſinking. Oh, bleſſe that fountain which could not bee dryed vp by ſinne! rather occaſioned it ſelfe to mercy by miſery. Wonder why Angels were left remedileſſe, not wee! Ponder it in our deepe feares, and remember the Goſpell of deliuerance is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God as well as the Law of terror: deſpaire not, the Lord cuts off none, who cut not off themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let it teach vs to gather to our ſelues a <label type="milestone">

For what elſe ſhould it profit vs that hee hath deuiſed ſuch a way as Chriſt and ſuch meanes as the Goſpell beleeued: except hee
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177956:66"/> tooke it vpon him to poſſeſſe the ſoule of it alſo? And the Holy Ghoſt is frequent in Scripture, to proue GOD the Father to be the onely free agent in this worke: calling him the <hi>begetter of vs, of his owne free will:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 1.17. Phil. 2.13 Heb. 10.23</note> the <hi>worker of both will and deede in vs of his owne good pleaſure:</hi> the <hi>faythfull beginner and finiſher of his owne worke.</hi> Eſpecially that it is neyther of the <hi>willer or runner:</hi>

And why? Surely, becauſe as in the way, ſo in the working the ſoule to it, hee ſeekes his owne glory, and the deepe riches of his grace to bee magnified, and himſelfe to be adored in the ioynt mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his iuſtice, mercy, power and truth in one: that <hi>through</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>praiſe may be giuen to GOD the Father:</hi> and that as <hi>all things are from him,</hi>

                  <p>This point well weighed, would leade vs as by a thred through each branch or Article of this ſecond part, with light and ſauour: when we conceiue the Lord Ieſus himſelfe onely as a Seruant of this ſouereigne will of GOD: who is therefore called <hi>Gods Chriſt,</hi>

A point of ſpeciall conſequence, and properly belonging to this place 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.17.18. hee beeing at the root of all, and <hi>beeing in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelfe, not imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinnes, till which great</hi> worke be effected, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance is not effected in vs. And therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. the Lord is ſayd <hi>to impute no ſinne,</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5.21. <hi>to make vs his righteouſnes.</hi>

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:177956:67"/>
                  <p>And, although I refer the point of Imputation to the ſecond Article of Chriſt, (as preſuppoſing his merit of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity) yet for the Worker, its properly a conſequent of this Article, God doing all his workes perfectly: and as I ſaid, freely for the attaining of his owne ends in vs, that he who boaſteth, might boaſt of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Doeth this point tend to any vſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea, and that ſuch, as I wiſh euery good hearer and reader of the points following, to lay it to heart.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, this will teach vs to conceaue in what ſence the Lord doth offer vs his Chriſt, command vs to beleeue, and promiſe to eaſe vs if we hunger, mourne, be poore in ſpirit: To wit, that he is farre from intimating any power or will in vs, to concurre with him in any the leaſt of theſe, or to aſcribe ought to him that <hi>willeth or runneth.</hi> But rather to ſhew what thoſe excellent graces are, which he freely worketh in all whom hee will ſaue. Hee for his honour ſake, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all theſe meanes in whomſoeuer hee hath appointed to the end it ſelfe of Redemption. Sweet is that place, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>That he may be admired in all ſuch as beleeue,</hi> becauſe they haue receiued our word <hi>in that day.</hi> He ſaith not that al they may be admired who haue themſelues beleeued: but he admired in them. For what? Surely not for their working grace in themſelues, but for the works ſake of God that hath wrought it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this will helpe vs to iudge, who thoſe parties are, in all likelyhood, whom God wil concurre with &amp; aſſiſt in the vſe of meanes tending to deliuerance. Such is the baſe ſlauery of man, that he diſtruſts him ſooner in no one thing, than in that wherein God offers himſelfe to the ſoule. As in <hi>Manoa's</hi> example and <hi>Gedeons</hi> appeares, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.22, &amp; 6.13. Oh, ſaith a fearefull heart, God is free, and need not worke, ſaue whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e he liſt, and therefore he is bound to none, and I feare he will worke in 100. ere he worke in me! Oh, poore wretch? hath hee not ſhewed his will, in whom hee will worke? Euen in thoſe that ſeeke his end more then their owne in the vſe of meanes. If thou knowing what God only
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177956:67"/> aymes at in all his Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of his rich grace, and all his holy Attributes (and not at thine or my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for our ends) ſhalt yet goe to worke heere thine own way, then know, God neuer did, or will croſſe his owne ends, nor bleſſe any ſuch as ſet vp other ends of their owne againſt, with, or aboue his. But this followeth ſoundly; That all ſuch as in meanes vſing, doe fixe their eye vpon Gods purpoſe, and abaſe themſelues in the ſight of their owne ſillineſſe, to reach ſuch a thing as deliuerance is; and adore his free ſouereigne working, as the onely able effecter hereof: all ſuch I ſay, as thus worke with God, and vnder God, may know that the Lord will aſſiſt them: for why? he aſſiſts and ſeconds his owne way in them who ſeeke his glory aboue their owne ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>And although he be ſo free, that he is tyed to none, yet I ſay (with reuerence) hee tyes himſelfe graciouſly to ſuch as doe ſeeke him, not themſelues, for elſe ſhould he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his owne ends, which is blaſphemous. And this point I deſire to be marked. For whoſo they are who will not ſee this truth of Gods free working for his owne glorious ends: I affirme its vnauoidable, but either they muſt moſt murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and repiningly reiect the way of God to Heauen, as contrary to fleſh, (which is the greateſt ſigne of a caſtaway) or elſe mixe themſelues their wits, wiſedome, policy, and deuices in the getting of heauen, with Gods grace and mercy and ſo make Chriſt onely a Stalking horſe to their owne parts, and to ſerue themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this point doth moſt liuely inſtruct vs how wee may ſo goe to worke in the vſe of meanes, as our owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may not accuſe vs, for taking Gods office of freedom and ſouereignty out of his hands. It troubleth many (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one particular) how they ſhould ſo goe to worke in hearing, praying, and Sacraments, for the attayning of the Condition of faith, that is mourning and hunger, &amp;c. that they might not ſeeke faith vpon their owne termes, They ſee the Word full of promiſes of eaſe and comfort, to ſuch as do mourne: and they would gladly ſeeke Heauen in Gods way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:177956:68"/> onely they cannot ſee how a condition to faith can be vrged of vs, without our owne labour and will be acceſſary (which if it be, what doth our doctrine of the condition differ from Popery, and her diſpſitions?) I anſwer, The reaſon of this darkneſſe is, becauſe men cannot be beaten from this, that in ſeeking theſe conditions, they muſt ſeek, firſt their owne good and welfare! This is the maine ayme of moſt hearers, if they haue faith, they are ſure to ſcape hell: and if they haue the conditions of faith wrought, faith will follow: hence the condition is ſo laid at by people: eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I anſwer, Yes, (now all ſorts vſe means, none are ſo vile, but they will be religious) but I will grant thee it. Is the queſtion whether thou be leſſe ill then ſuch, or whether thy ayme bee ſound in ſeeking the condition or no! If ſo, then I ſay, thou in ayming finally that it may goe well with thee, differs not in kinde from ſuch an one! No, the honeſt ſoule ſets vp God in his own way of Chriſt, in his owne ends, the glory of all his attributes (that he may be admired in working faith in ſuch a wretch) the freedome of his working, that in all theſe her owne thoughts, affections and zeale, might ſtinke as <hi>Peters</hi> nets did, (when Chriſt ſo ſtrangely had fiſhed for him) and the truth is, her ſcope is as much to abhorre her ſelfe, and looke into an higher cauſe, as thine is to get Heauen for thy ſelfe. She ſeeks the glory of His wiſedome, power, mercy and freedome; who ſought out ſuch a deliuerance, workes it in her, and all that concerne it, faith and the conditions of it: the thought of the <hi>Aſſes</hi> is turned to the thought for the <hi>Sonne:</hi> ſhee ſees that diuine purity and excellency in being Gods inſtrument to theſe ends, that ſhe looſes her ſelfe, and all in the meditation thereof, and ſuffers the Lord to ſaue her, while her ſoule is ſet to adore him in his owne ends, as moſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177956:68"/> precious. And ſetting this ayme aſide, her ſeeking the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, is but as a morall worke with her, ſauoring of her ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Some will alledge, Doe ye thinke euery weake beginner to bee ſo holy as to preferre Gods glory to his owne Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No, not all, but I take them to be in forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it, and not farre from it. And ſecondly I ſay, its one thing to aske ſuch a queſtion of a weake beginner (who would perhaps ſtagger at it) another thing to ſay what God workes in ſuch a one, although he know it not! For ſure it is, ſuch is Gods worke in his, as to conuince them by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that all ſeeking of grace, for a mans owne happineſſe, is poore ſeeking (for the preſent, till God worke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and all ſeeking for ſelfe muſt be from ſelfe and by ſelfe. But when the boate is tyed to the ſhip of Gods glory, ſhee needs no more rowing of herſelfe, then the boate doth: its enough for her, that ſhe is ſet vpon ſuch a ſtreame, and tyed to ſuch a ſhip, as can carry her of it ſelfe, and drowne all her owne welfare in the Lord.

                  <p>And although it be needleſſe for vs to deſcant whether the Lord out of his deepe wiſdome could haue found out any other way, but this to ſaue vs: yet this we may ſay, that ſeeing this is the Lordes way, it behooues vs to thinke it the beſt.

For ſeeing a greater and fuller could not be, what iniuſtice were it for God to put that vpon his Sonne, which might haue bin put vpon an inferior mediator?

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:177956:72"/> do mutually ſerue each other. The vſe is, that wee his members might acknowledge him an eminent Mediator, as hauing a calling from GOD, as thoſe three ſorts of Men had vnder the old Teſtament. And that we might be out of doubt, that the acts and ſuffrings he performed, were allowed, according to that voice, <hi>This is my well beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleaſed: heare him.</hi> And that wee, knowing into what treaſure the Lord hath put all his graces (euen the fleſh of Chriſt) might there ſeeke and finde them all.

                  <p>Firſt, let vs abhorre the cocceit of ſuch Sectaries, as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there was no neceſſity at all of any ſuch price pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Iuſtice: nor any barre in Gods Iuſtice at all, why hee might not haue ſhewed mercy to ſinners, without any ſuch ſatiſfaction made at all. Its an horrible derogation to the Scriptures, and to the wiſdome of GOD: and ſauoreth of a profane audacious ſpirit, making ſinne and grace of ſmall eſteeme. Rather let it preſent to vs the hideous nature of ſinne and iuſtice. <hi>Salomon</hi> bids vs behold the drunkard in his rednes of colour, blueneſſe of wounds, that wee might loath his ſinne. But rather behold it in this glaſſe of the Lord Ieſus his ſatiſfaction. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 63.1. <hi>Who is he that commeth from Bozra, with his red garments? I haue trod the wine preſſe of the wrath of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> If the glaſſe of the Law haue not done it, let this do it, yea behold the ſinnes which we count moſt veniall in this obiect of Iuſtice. Not the pettyeſt oath, or leaſt of our vaine wordes could be payd for, with the price of a leſſer thing then the blood of Chriſt; Iuſtice would admit of no other. And the <hi>Father ſpared not his onely Sonne</hi> in this point: but would haue him drinke the dregs of his wrath. What ſhall become of ſuch wretches then as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe this price? How ſhall they ſtruggle with this infinite wrath of GOD, which the Lord Ieſus had bin cruſht vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as vnſupportable, if his Godhead had not held him vp? Now while ſinne is in her element, its counted as light as feathers; but being vnder the weight of iuſtice, and the ſence of wrath, it will prooue intolerable. Let vs count it ſo now, whiles wee may get it ſhrowded vnder the Lord Ieſus: let vs ſweat water and blood, and feele that in vs which cauſed thoſe outcryes, <hi>My GOD my GOD, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Not to become Mediators to our ſelues, but to driue vs to him that ouercame this anguiſh,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> and was heard in that he feared.</p>
                  <p>If ſin in our ſelues will not breake our hearts, let it breake them in the view of CHRIST broken by them: let vs,

To ſay, Oh, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, heere is the ſurety, lay no debt or puniſhment vpon theſe debtors! I haue taken all vpon me, if thou wilt needs haue the vttermoſt, powre out thy wrath vpon him that can ſatisfie, not vpon them that cannot! Try whether there be any drop of mourning in thee, by this due ſight of ſinne and iuſtice, and ſay, Oh, Lord, if I were left to bee my owne ſatisfier, if thou ſhouldſt haue ſaid to Chriſt, as once to <hi>Moſes, Them that ſinne againſt mee, I will puniſh, of thee I will require nothing,</hi> Oh, how terrible had our condition beene?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, all Sectaries, who that they might be ſingular (to ſay <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And whereas they adde, Gods Iuſtice accepted this for an equall price of ſinne: I anſwer, Who hath taught them to dreame of an acceptance, of that which is not equivalent to Iuſtice? Might they not aſwell ouerthrow any neceſſity of a ſatisfying Iuſtice, as teach Iuſtice to accept that which is not Iuſtice? Is it not well for vs, that the Lord will accompt a truly iuſt ſatisfaction of a ſurety to anſwer our debt, (which was more then he ought vs) but wee muſt goe about to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:177956:81"/> the price it ſelfe, and dreame of an imputing of equall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to an vnequall price? Let vs abhorre ſuch nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and know, if Chriſt ſuffred no more then the malice of man, there remayneth a neceſſity of a ſecond ſuffring for vs, from iuſtice. Let vs beware, while we goe about to minſe and leſſen the ſuffrings of Chriſt; leſt we deſtroy the truth of a Mediator, and bereaue the ſoule of that which ſhould vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her, in her conflict with Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſpeake of vnſauory dallyance with thoſe Texts, which are brought to confute them, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and others. To conclude, except Chriſt ſuffred more then from man, we may ſay, that many Martyrs exceeded him in their patience, of whom we read no ſuch outcryes as Chriſt made.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>2</label> Secondly, let it teach vs to abhorre the opinion of thoſe <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who teach that our Iuſtification ſtands in the ſo applying of Chriſt righteouſneſſe to a ſinner, that hee may pleade it from the tenor of the Law; <hi>Doe this and liue.</hi> Meaning that wee muſt be poſſeſſed with the very ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame righteouſneſſe wherewith Chriſt obeyed and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</p>
                  <p>And this they imagine to be the matter of our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that elſe God cannot in Iuſtice acquite vs. They ſay, The elect doe ſuſtaine one perſon with Chriſt, in all his acts and ſuffrings, and they are all made theirs: But thus they make Chriſt ſerue to no other ends, but to become our owne Mediator, and to deſtroy his owne.</p>
                  <p>The error of this conceit aroſe from a confounding of the valor or worth of this righteouſneſſe, with the ſubſtance of righteouſneſſe it ſelfe. For although wee cannot be iuſtified without imputation of the fulneſſe of the merit, yet wee are not capable of that which merited, except wee will become infinite.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>3</label> Thirdly, it confutes thoſe Sectaries, who affirme that God ſeeth no ſin in any of his, if hee haue once imputed Chriſts righteouſneſſe to them. This error arizes from not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing theſe two, Imputation of perfect righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177956:81"/> and perfect imputing or accepting of imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>No man is iuſtified without the former: but our faith fayling in the acceptance, muſt needs bee looked vpon by God. I confeſſe hee ſees no ſinne, but hee pardons it to his in Chriſt, vpon Faith and Repentance: but hee puniſhes it for their good in mercy. Againe, what if we grant, God ſees no ſinne in them in reſpect of their iuſtification? Is therefore their ſanctification perfect. Why then did <hi>Dauids</hi> adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſpleaſe the Lord? Or why doe we pray, <hi>Forgiue vs our debts?</hi> or why ſaith our Sauiour, <hi>Say when all is done, yee are vnprofitable?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it confutes all ſuch as cut off the Actiue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>4</label> of Chriſt, from the ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.4</note> as they cut the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeruants by the middle. I blame them not as Papiſts, for denying Chriſt to bee our price, but for their curious diuiding of one member of it, from another. It may bee granted them that the Paſſiue is the more immediate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummation of the ſatisfaction: but to conclude, the Actiue is moſt audacious.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, Chriſt was bound to the obeying of the Law, as <hi>a man made vnder it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwere, Yea, but except hee had beene ſo made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for vs, hee needed neuer to bee ſo at all: therefore his willing being ſo, made the merit the greater: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though being a man, he muſt obey: yet ſeing his being a man, was that hee might obey for vs, it muſt bee of greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
                  <p>Againe as the Paſſiue is the neerer merit, in reſpect of the eſtate, in which we ſtood accurſed: So the Actiue is as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall in reſpect of recouering that Image of righteouſneſſe, which makes vs like GOD, and in which wee were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Neither was it Hell could haue hurt vs without ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Beſides (to ſay truth) if <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſinne had not beene accurſed, yet in ſinning onely he had beene miſerable. It is therefore as eſſentiall to Iuſtification, that hee bee made

                  <p>In the firſt reſpect, though the Lord Ieſus his fleſh was not exempt from mortality and infirmity, but ſubiect to all through our ſinne: yet euen vnder all theſe through his whole life, hee conquered in ſuffring: for hee endured no more then him pleaſed: before the time of his death, no enemy had power ouer him, to ſurprize him by any caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by any other death, or at any other ſeaſon then himſelfe would. In <hi>Luke</hi> 4. wee read, that his owne citizens <hi>Led him vp to the brow of the Hill to haue brkeo his necke.</hi> Oft were Officers ſent, to take him: ſtones caſt at him: vpon the Sea hee was ſubiect to the violence of the waues: none of theſe had power to faſten vpon him, hee went thorow the midſt of them, and thorow a thouſand deaths, without caſualty. It was prophecied of him,<note place="margin">Eſay. 43.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The fire ſhould not burne him, nor waters deuoure him: till his houre was come to ſuffer that death,</hi> and onely that which GOD had layd out for him. And then nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, at death, although as our Mediator he muſt needs drink that cup, which his Father gaue him: yet he was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror euen then too, and aboue any enemy. <hi>Iudas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> could doe no more, then himſelfe was willing to yeeld to his Father in. <hi>No man takes away my life from me,</hi>

                  <p>So thirdly, after death, when they had got his dead body into the graue, thinking that the ſealing of the ſtone could haue made him theirs, neuer to riſe any more: Lo, by his power hee kept his vnion ſtill, and after his fourty houres ſleepe was ouer, hee reſumed his body and ſoule againe, and gaue them another blow worſe then all: roze againe, conquered their malice, neuer more to be conquered, <hi>to dye no more:</hi> All the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Hell, and vpon Earth, could not any further aſſault him: his triumph being begun, he was out of their reach.</p>

                  <p>By the ſecond phraſe, we muſt conceaue one thing to bee meant. For its familiar with <hi>Paul</hi> to vſe theſe two phraſes for one thing, namely, imputation of Faith, and of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Not that faith can in any ſence be our righteouſnes: but becauſe Chriſt apprehended by faith, is the ſame thing, with Faith it ſelfe in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we know, faith muſt euer concurre with imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the act of it; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt honors it, with the name of being imputed to righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>That Faith muſt needs ſo concurre, note three things in this worke:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God enables the Soule to beleeue on the Lord Ieſus by the promiſe, and the ſpirit thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Soule yeeldeth and conſenteth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God caſteth heereby this righteouſneſſe, (thus beleeued) vpon the Soule, and imputes it to pardon and life,</p>
                  <p>Faith then alway concurres with imputation: the life wherto may be ſaid of iuſtification, which it were blaſphemy to aſcribe to faith (ſeeing its God that iuſtifieth) but yet Faith is ſtill ſaid to iuſtify, becauſe of her neceſſary concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>The which Phraſe is tropicall, <hi>the inſtrument being put for the principall agent.</hi> Otherwiſe in proper ſpeech, alas! How ſhall poore faith apprehend in the ſoule an infinite righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, except we take it thus, that God by faith (as his owne inſtrument) doth conuey all the obiect of Chriſt at once into vs?</p>
                  <p>And this I would haue the Reader to marke for two cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, to decide that Queſtion ſo much demanded, whether faith apply Chriſt in each of his merits particularly, or no?</p>
                  <p>To which I ſay, that it is the worke of God the Father, to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:177956:91"/> proportion the merits of Chriſt Ieſus in particular to the ſoules need: its God the Father, who accepts the merit, and therfore he onely can proportion it. Poor finite faith (though it know neuer ſo much of the particular merit) yet cannot do it, becauſe the merit is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Faith onely hearing the offer of God (already reconciled and appeaſed by this merit) to be freely tendred to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues this tender as God makes it, that is, all the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus made by God to the ſoule, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, and what elſe ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>So that whether wee comprehend the thing offred or no, its no materiall: if we beleeue the offer to be truly made to vs, we receaue it in the kind wherein God beſtowes it; and in a word, when we cannot comprehend it, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends vs.</p>
                  <p>So that faith is caſting of the ſoule vpon the offer of Chriſt from the Father, giuing him all at once in all his good things (which the Spirit reueales; and the more the better) yet faith is not in this moſt to bee admired for particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying each benefit, but for her accepting of what the Lord hath couched in the offer, that is, whole Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, this anſwer is to be noted againſt a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall opinion of ſome, that hold, the Act of Beleeuing, to be that which God accepts to iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>A dangerous conceit! which makes Chriſt a meer ſeruant to faith, and vnder the colour of aſcribing honour to faith, takes away all Chriſts preeminence. For although this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exclude not Chriſt wholly, from the reckoning, yet in the act of iuſtifying, it onely giues all to the worke of faith. And they ſay, As the act of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin condemned him: ſo the act of our faith iuſtifies vs.</p>
                  <p>But the Paralell is fooliſh and abſurd. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin might condemne himſelfe and vs: but our faith can neither ſaue ours nor our ſelues, of it ſelfe: that which it ſaues vs by, is the obiect and merit which it apprehends, and that by the act of Gods imputing it to vs.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>You ſeeme to make imputation an act of Gods free grace:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:177956:92"/> but the word is vſed as an act of iuſtice, for Paul ſaith,</hi> To him who worketh, righteouſneſſe is imputed by debt?</p>

For its as if a man ſhould ſay to his debtor, Pay me an hundreth pound, and I will impute it as an whole diſcharge. This we know is no proper ſpeech, for in ſuch a caſe its ſmall thanke to him to impute that, for which hee is bound to giue acquittance: ſo that imputing (properly) is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>For it is ſuch an act of God, as comming betweene our beleeuing and his iuſtifying, doth not legally take any diſcharge of debt from vs, but doth graciouſly impute that which is not ours, as if it were ours, for the making of vs guiltleſſe and accepted.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>I conceaue you ſomewhat better. Howbeit I ſtill ſee that imputation is of ſuch a thing as is our owne really: why then not as well of a thing inherent,</hi> viz. <hi>a righteouſneſſe of our owne, as the Papiſts dreame?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe theſe two haue a winde difference, <hi>viz.</hi> to be really made ours, and to be from, or inherently in vs. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed, cannot iuſtify vs, except it be ours, how be it it is ſo, not becauſe it comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within vs, but becauſe its caſt vpon vs; and in a word, its not firſt in vs and then imputed: but firſt imputed, and then made ours.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But can meere imputation make a thing really ours?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea. Nothing can be more reall then imputation. The imputing of a man is reall, when he imputes an vncertain and vndue payment, as if certaine and due; and this is good and firme among men.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.19, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> not imputing <hi>Shemei's</hi> rayling, is a ſufficient releaſe to him of the offence and puniſhment. The imputing of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to vs, is as reall, as if we had beene in the garden with him. Chriſts taking our guilt vpon him, was as reall, and as really felt, as if himſelfe had been the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177956:92"/> offender. And ſhal not his imputed righteouſneſſe be as reall as if our ſelues could in our owne perſons haue ſatisfied, or as if we had needed none? Yes verily.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What iſſueth then from this imputation of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>As once he ſcattred thoſe accuſers of the woman, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9 ſo that none came in to accuſe her, but turned their backs with confuſion, and ſo diſcharged the woman: ſo doth hee heere: hauing diſabled all euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt vs, he doth impute blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe vnto vs, and declare to vs our righteouſneſſe, yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming vs righteous.)</p>
                  <p>And as the Creditor abhorres to receaue the debt of his debters ſurety, and yet to compt him a debtor ſtill: ſo the Lord hauing accepted Chriſts price for vs, abhorres ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able his Sons payment, as to require the debt at our hands the ſecond time: but rather diſables his owne Wrath and Iuſtice from thinking of any further demand of vs. And (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the freedome of it.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The Vſes are many. Let mee begin with you of my owne Congregation, to whom although as dead, yet I ſpeake (this being, as you know, the laſt Sermon I preacht among you) let I ſay, my admonition vnto you, be this: It hath not bin with you as with euery Congregation wherein preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath beene.</p>
                  <p>To you I may truly ſay, That now toward theſe 56. yeeres the Lord Ieſus hath beene crucifyed among you.

                  <p>Giue me leaue to ſay vnto you, in this fiue or ſixe yeeres paſt (beſides Sermons) God hath reuiued the Doctrine of Chriſt &amp; Sacraments: of ſelfdeniall, faith, the ſatisfaction, the imputation of righteouſneſſe, among you: (and God grant you long to enioy the doctrine and practice of theſe grounds) but what anſwer ſhall ye make to God, if as he hath walked in and out at large with you in all his truths, opening vnto you all theſe welſprings of ſaluation, and concealing nothing from you, which humane weakeneſſe hath been able to vtter, you ſtill ſhall fayle and come ſhort of ſuch people, as (I may truly ſay) haue had but the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> among them?</p>
                  <p>Thus I ſpeake in reſpect of that cleare light of all Chriſt, both in his ſatisfaction and Gods imputation, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon vrged vnto you.</p>

                  <p>So is faith admitted in a ſort to doe all vnder God, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify, to impute, to reconcile and the reſt: becauſe ſhee is made for the nonce, ſhe is loyall, and made for the honor of God: al that can be (thinking her ſelfe ſafe when ſhe can ſet the Crowne vpon his head) but abhorring all trechery, She is a Grace that excels all which <hi>Adam</hi> euer had: becauſe ſhee hides all her life, hopes, and welfare with Chriſt in God: he that ſteales away her treaſure, muſt rob the Lord firſt, who keeps it.</p>

I may ſay, the Lord deales for the ſoules of his people, as for the mindes: hee hath ſo written the Scriptures, that if any obſcurities remaine, they are about things of circumſtance, which are not ſo abſolutely needfull to be knowne: but if they be of weight and eſſence, they are left plaine and euident.</p>

                  <p>Now, it is not the hearing of his giuing of Chriſt, nor of a ſatisfaction, which can quiet her: but this, that ſhee may know its giuen and performed for her. Heere therefore in this fourth Article, I ſay, The offended Father hath accepted this ſatisfaction, is well pleaſed with it, his heart is made placable by it, and now his heart is opened, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of loue bared towards a poore wretch: and this hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by a proclamation, and by an offer of grace to them, if they will beleeue him to meane as he ſpeakes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Goſpell in the Miniſtery of reconciliation, is the inſtrument of this Reuelation, and that both fully and onely.</p>
                  <p>The point is plaine, all the Word witneſſeth it. <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, that <hi>when the loue of GOD appeared, then hee ſaued vs:</hi> This appearance is the light of the Goſpell, and <hi>the ariſing of the day ſtarre thereby in the heart.</hi> Reade by name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>GOD that commanded light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, hath ſhined into our hearts.</hi> See the place.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now yet this Goſpell is not the meane, in reſpect of the bare letters and ſyllables of it, but in the <hi>Miniſtery of Reconciliation.</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8, 9. where <hi>Paul</hi> cals it the <hi>Ministration of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornes it with termes of honour aboue the Lawes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, See that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of this great gift of Chriſt, twiſe ioynes this with it, And <hi>hee hath made vs Miniſters of Reconciliation:</hi> as if this were a materiall point: Wee <hi>the Miniſters of God, beſeech you, bee reconciled: receaue not the grace of God in vaine.</hi>

                  <p>Its reported of a certaine Merchant of London (in the Story of England) that he made much of a poore Cobler that dwelt by him, a cankred Papiſt, and did as good as maintaine him; yet this Traytor went about to betray him to death: This Merchant hauing eſcaped his hands, yet out of his loue, vſed all meanes to bee friends with him againe, and vſed him as before: all this would not doe, his heart was ſo villainous, he would ſhunne the way of him, and not looke at him. It fell ſo out at length, that he met him in ſuch a narrow lane, as he could not balke him, but muſt needs talke with him. The good Merchant takes him to him, and told him, he was glad he had met him, &amp; he wondred what he meant ſo to decline from him! What ſaid he, do you thinke me your enemy? If I were, could I not cruſh yee with a word ſpeaking? Alas, I am not offended with you, if you be not with me, for all your treachery, but forgiue and forget it. The words of this man ſo pierced the Coblers heart, that it brake inſtantly, and hee falling downe vpon his knees, and with bitter reares confeſſed his villainy, and repenting of it, told him, This loue ſhould for euer bind him vnto him, and ſo he continued.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Generally in this, that they bee Brethren. No ſooner is a man a beleeuer and a new Creature, borne to GOD, but hee is alſo a brother, or ſhe a ſiſter of thoſe that are bredde: both Relations goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>So then, firſt thou muſt bee a member of this body, a citizen of this Ieruſalem, a ſonne and daughter of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and a ſiſter of the Church, a free denizon of this corporation: or elſe thou art not ſo much as generally quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Touching the grounds of this, I will not heere preuent my ſelfe, for I ſhall handle the point of fayth and the New creature in their places: onely heere I ſay, in theſe this qualification conſiſts: No baſtard, no Gibeonite, no ſtranger, no blemiſht one may enter the Temple of this Communion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and more ſpecially, that they haue the true ſpirit of Brethren, of members: by which the former is manifeſted to be true. For all that are truly borne children, and legitimate, haue the true ſpirit of ſuch: and alſo of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: this Spirit of Communion therefore is the tryall of ſound ones from Countetfeits.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Shew then ſome markes of this Spirit of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As the Philoſophers ſay, There is a ſoule of the world which holds together the parts: ſo much more, there is a Spirit of Communion which vnites the members of it. As the parts of the body of man would looſen and fall aſunder, if there were not inſtruments of ſinewes, of muſcles, of ligaments aptly ioyning them: ſo heere. This Spirit of Communion then is the ſame with the Spirit of vnion: though in a ſeuerall conſideration, hee that is one with God that begat,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>But to the point; this Spirit of Communion, may
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:177956:102"/> bee diſcouered in theſe two particulars.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, In the ſpirit of Furniture for the ſeuerall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby Communion may be ſupported.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the former of theſe, viz. Preſeruing of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Its a qualification, whereby it is with the members of this myſticall body, as it is with all other bodies, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Naturall, or politique: it hath an inſtinct giuen vnto it to preſerue her ſelfe in her eſtate, from diſſolution and ruine. No body hath ſo cloſe &amp; neere a Sympathy to it ſelfe as this: nothing need teach any liuing member in the body, to preſerue it ſelfe and the body in which it ſubſiſts: inſtinct doth it alone. So heere: for the opening whereof, conſider theſe few things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This ſpirit of Selfe-preſeruation in the Church, is the ſpirit of Separation of different or contrary parts which threaten ruine to her. Metals melted will goe together and vnite their ſubſtance, but ſeuer the droſſe, which is of another nature from incorporating with them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>The Citizen of the heauenly Ieruſalem is brought in by his loathing quality: he loathes Swearers, lyers, forſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, vſurers, and ſo of the reſt: the ſcope is, a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Communion, diſcernes a non-member, a Neuter, and loaths to intermixe or vnite with them: As <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>

                  <p>They may thruſt in themſelues into fellowſhip vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned, but ſo farre as they are knowne, the Spirit of Communion ſegregates them from her ſelfe.

                     <hi>A.</hi> Sociableneſſe, a compound of three cordes not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily broken. <hi>viz. Amiableneſſe, Humbleneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Selfe-deniall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.15.</note>Amiableneſſe is that holy ſuauity of Spirit, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes tartneſſe, auſterity, ſowreneſſe and ſullenneſſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are like ragged vnhewne ſtones, vnmeet to couch in this holy building. Contrariwiſe, amiableneſſe is a gentle and alluring facility of ſpirit, which both puts forth it ſelfe to all courteous and gentle behauiour, and alſo draws affection and delight from others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note>Many are ſo hatefull and hating, ſo dogged, churilſh and harſh in their temper, that they are indiſpoſed for ſociety: more fit to be Monks or Ancorits then Chriſtians, through their Timon-like diſpoſition. But amiableneſſe is that grace, that both acts and prouokes all louing offices of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note>Humbleneſſe is a grace which oppoſes pride, a vice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate from true fellowſhip of Saints: cauſing men to thinke themſelues, their parts, their perſons too good for Communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.16</note>Humility thinks ſo meanly of it ſelfe, that it reioyces, it may bee compted worthy to bee <hi>a doore keeper in this houſe of Communion:</hi> and is glad it may bee admitted vnto it.

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13. &amp; 11.3</note>The latter abhorreth all diſdaine, partiality, and want of indifferency in this Communion. We ſay of <hi>friendſhip, Either

                  <p>If it find equality, it ſanctifies it: as betweene Husband and Wife, Children, Friends, Men of like quality, Calling, State, Gifts, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Tradeſmen, cutting the ſinewes of enuy, and planting a moſt euen likeneſſe of mind, of Spirit, and harmony betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>But if not, yet as the roundnes of the earth reduces al vneuen parts to one figure, ſo this, all incongruities, diſlikes, partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, if not to an exact, yet to a competent equalneſſe and proportion.</p>
                  <p>The third grace of Sociableneſſe is Selfedeniall: Which <hi>Paul</hi> cals, A mynding and ſeeking of the things of others, as well as our owne.

                  </p>
                  <p>The contrary to this, is ſelfe and ſelfeloue, the bane of Communion, when men ſeeke their own eſteeme, their own credit, ends, profit and prayſe: and if they fayle hereof, they little look how the publike welfare goes forward. We know a priuate Wealth is contrary to a Commonwealth: So is Selfeloue to Communion. So that where this threefold cord is knit, there is a great qualification of the ſoule to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>

                  <p>Tender conſcience is now called Singularity: as if it euer had been ſo in the Church, that in all caſes of difference, there could be eſtabliſhed one conſent: Nay, its ſtrange to ſee how cuſtome and preiudice haue hardned men from all tendernes and compaſſion.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the Exercize of Communion in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As the commodity to bee ſold is, ſo is the market. Looke of what accompt wares are, in the traffique of men, ſuch are the graces of the Spirit in the Communion of Saints. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 4, 6, 7. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. They are the chiefe commodity that the members of this body trade for.</p>
                  <p>As earthly men are ſome Merchants of Pearles, or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So theſe are Merchants of Graces: and if they raiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues an eſtate in theſe, in <hi>Precious Faith,</hi> in <hi>Liuely hope,</hi> in <hi>Patience, Thankefulneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> they compt themſelues to haue made the beſt of all markets.</p>
                  <p>And as the greater the trading is among men, and the more the returne, the richer is the Merchant: ſo heere, the more plentifull the Merchants, and the commodities to bee ſold are, the richer are the traders therein.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may the ſoule trade for Grace? What are the Rules to be obſerued therein?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, each member in this ſtaple of Communion, muſt get the gift of exchange. He muſt not beare the mind to be for himſelfe onely, but muſt maintaine a due entercourſe, and exchange of <hi>Grace for grace.</hi> Looke what the Lord Ieſus our head is to all the body, that the members by deriuation are to bee to each other. Read <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.17. Bee ſure then firſt, that thou bring in thy ſtocke into this banke; remembring that all the members of communion haue the ſame ſtock of ſanctification, giuen them to trade withall: they are furniſht with Talents, more or leſſe for this encreaſe, and aduantage by other. Read <hi>Luke</hi> 19.13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.15. Alſo <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.13. Hence it is that they are all ſaid to <hi>partake of one Spirit:</hi> and 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. Euery one beleeuer <hi>hath this hope:</hi> as if no grace ought to be a ſtranger to any member in this body, for
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:177956:106"/> the kind thereof. Now then hauing this ſtocke, each muſt afford grace to other (ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29.) as one doth preſent his ware in the market to another. And this is to be free of Gods market: to be holy chapmen and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers therin. As in the <hi>Prouerbs</hi> chap. 1.14. thoſe lewd ones ſay, <hi>Come, caſt in thy lot among vs, let vs haue one purſe:</hi> ſo is it heere. And this <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the <hi>Dispenſation of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold graces of God,</hi> See his 1. Ep. 4.10. <hi>Paul to Philemon,</hi> verſe 20. cals the Hauing ioy of him, and <hi>refreſhing his bowels in the Lord.</hi> Get then this treaſure into thee firſt, (as the trader gets himſelfe ſiluer, which anſwers all things) and then, bury not thy talent, but exchange, and trade, buy &amp; ſell, afford good penny worths, liue by the gayne of all gracious examples, ſpeeches, behauiours, conuerſings in this Communion. Our Lord Ieſus his ſpeech was, <hi>It is better to giue, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Grace was put into thee for vſe, euen the good of the body? therefore conceale it not, ſhare with the Grace of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and out of the treaſure of thy good heart, bring forth good things.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What other Rule do you giue for this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Secondly, humility is another excellent meane to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Communion in graces. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. Which is, <hi>To preferre others graces before our owne:</hi> and to thinke no otherwiſe, nor deſire, others ſhould thinke of vs otherwiſe, then as wee are: <hi>condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to them of meane degree.</hi> Proud ones get little, and doe little in the communion of Saints. They get little:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe euery one thinks them to bee ſuch as need not prayer, need not counſell, example: their great ſhew make men leſſe tender of them; but a good man deſires, his wants ſhould rather draw forth the help of others, then his gifts ſeeme to need none.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the proud man diſdaynes to ſpy grace in any, ſaue in ſome eminent paternes, and men of note, for learning, wit or parts. But humbleneſſe ſpyes grace euen thorow the cloud of meane eſtate, learning, parts: it lookes narrowly,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:177956:106"/> and ſpyes oftentimes great grace in a meane man, for attire, for carriage, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>hion.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of Grace carries the eye of the humble to the treaſure where it lyes, lye it neuer ſo cloſe and low. Againe, humble ones are both fitter to commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cate and to receaue. The former, becauſe they thinke they can fall no lower nor loſe any great credit, for they haue no great thing to loſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that when ſelfeloue will chuze to haue no prayer at all, then to forfeit her repute: humbleneſſe will truſt God with her ſelfe, and pray. The latter, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing empty, they are hungry: and the hungry are gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>They are truly <hi>ſeruants of the Seruants of God.</hi> Not that an humble man denies the grace of God: but becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues, that eyther hee is indeed the meaneſt of others in grace: or elſe that his better graces dwell not ſo well as other mens: becauſe darkned with more corruptions then other mens ſmaller.</p>
                  <p>The humble Chriſtian is in loue with the Graces of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and out of loue with himſelfe. Hee enuies not, ſlights not others: hee ſees the vncomely parts often more graced then the comely: and beholds a pearle, (as of patience, wiſe ſpeech, cheerfulneſſe, mercy, loue,) euen in the dunghill of the meaneſt outſide.</p>

                     <hi>Couet the things that are moſt excellent.</hi> Eſpecially thoſe wherein others excell vs moſt. Appetite after the graces of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, is the inſtinct of Gods Spirit, for the growth of graces. Many dwell much vpon any gift they haue, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove it: but they ſee not where the hedge is loweſt, to amend it.</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:177956:107"/>
                  <p>Coueting then is, to eſteeme the good for that which is precious in them, and to ſeeke it earneſtly, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.22. <hi>That which is deſireable in a man, is his goodneſſe.</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the King of Sodom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.21. <hi>Giue me the ſoules, take thou the prey:</hi> ſo the hungry heart couets communion for graces: other things ſhee ſeekes in other places, riches and pleaſure, and the like: but Grace ſhee ſeekes where the Spirit of Grace lyes. Men that hunt the Bezor, ſeeke not her fleſh, but that which is precious in her, the ſtone which is ſo cordiall.</p>
                  <p>Baſe reſpects are nothing to the Saints, in compariſon of this Iewell. And this they ſeeke couetouſly, as <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>If by any meanes I might attaine, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed its the onely meane to procure it; for who, knowing the price of grace, will helpe them to it, who are indifferent whether they haue it or not?</p>
                  <p>The Lord Ieſus, when hee ſaw the poore woman would not giue him ouer, till ſhee had her deſire, powred out all his treaſure vpon her, <hi>Matthew</hi> 15.28. And ſo, importunity is a maine helpe to communion in graces.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the laſt meane to attaine grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A gift to extract it out of ſuch as haue it in them. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.6. <hi>There is wiſedome in the heart of the Wiſe; and a man of vnderstanding will get it out.</hi> There muſt be a deep bucket to diue into a deep well, to fetch out the water of it.

That <hi>Shunamite</hi> reſted not in the ſtaff: which <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi> had: ſhe would haue the skill of the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>So doth each Chriſtian: applyes himſelfe to extract the gift of another; as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.30.34. <hi>Layed eies to eies, and face to face of the child whom he reſtored.</hi> Some excell in this more then others, <hi>Delila</hi> lay at <hi>Samſon,</hi> till hee had told her his whole heart. So ſhouldſt thou that ſeekeſt the grace of others.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, let faith be the chiefe Extractor. Beleeue the graces of the body to be giuen for thy vſe, not onely in the ordinances, but euen in priuate conuerſe. <hi>All things are yours,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is ſuch an exerciſe of Communion, as whereby the Church of Chriſt doth edify her ſelfe in &amp; by the ordinance of GOD, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doe theſe ordinances of GOD edify the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two wayes; firſt, as they are Tyes and bandes of Communion: ſecondly, as they are actiue inſtruments &amp; helps to beget and nouriſh it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. How are the ordinances of God Tyes and Bands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In that they are appointed by GOD to bee the ſinnewes and cordes of vnion (not onely of the Church to God himſelfe) but of the members each to other. Without the which the members would ſcatter, and be diſſolued. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. Ieruſalem is called <hi>a compacted City</hi> knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the <hi>Aſſemblyes,</hi> by the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> by the <hi>Thrones of Iudgement</hi> Read it. So <hi>Paul Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. <hi>One God, one Baptiſme, one fayth:</hi> noting that the Churches mutual intereſt in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Sacraments, doth knit her in one Communion. Thus its ſayd, that the Church <hi>continued and claue together</hi> (after the Aſcenſion) in the vſe of the ordinances,<note place="margin">Act. 2.46. and 4.32.</note> the Sacrament eſpecially of the Supper.</p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:177956:108"/>
                  <p>Experience teacheth, that the fellowſhip of the word, prayer and the like, is the life, ſtrength, blood and marrow of Communion. Hence it is that they are called the <hi>Banners, Enſignes, Standards of Chriſt, and the Miniſters the Bearers thereof.</hi> For as Souldiers flocke to the Standard and Enſigne; ſo doe theſe Doues of Chriſt <hi>Fly to theſe windowes,</hi> and the youth of his wombe, to theſe Aſſemblies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2 Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Bread we breake, and the Wine wee drinke, are they not our Communion with the body of Chriſt?</hi> meaning, that as they knit vs to him, ſo doe they knit vs each to other. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Saints partake like precious Faith.</hi> We are ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. to bee <hi>come to Mount Zion, and the Aſſemblies of iuſt men.</hi> Why? ſaue that heereby we might be ſtrengthned in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p>We ſee that the Common tyes of nature, education, and place, doe much tye men together: To haue had one father, to haue lyen in one wombe, to haue dwelt in one towne, to haue fed at one boord, to haue beene brought vp in one fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Nurſery, are bands of fellowſhip: how much more all theſe Spirituall tyes in one? In particular, how dare wee come to the Supper of Chriſt without loue? Why? becauſe it is (as it is called) a Sacrament of Communion; a tye and band of Gods people, into a more cloſe and firme league of amity, then elſe they could enioy. So alſo the decency, order, beauty of the ordinances of hearing, of prayer, of faſting (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the purity thereof) what ſingular helpes are they to Communion! Yea, the members of the Triumphant Church, the Angels themſelues are tyed to the Militant by the ordinances, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>When the faithfull members of Chriſt behold with what holy <hi>Claspes and Taches,</hi> (not of ſiluer or braſſe) the Lord hath faſtned the parts of his Tabernacle together: when they behold each in other, the Reuerence, the Zeale, the Feare, the Ioy, and all the gracious diſpoſitions with which they meet God in Hearing, Praying, Receauing: how muſt they needs hee vnited in neere affection, and loue? Not to

As <hi>Nehemia</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Shall ſuch a one as I flee? Nehem.</hi> 6.11. So doe the faithfull, Shall ſuch as we, who enioy ſuch Ordinances, and haue ſuch a Charter of Priuiledges, quarrell, contend, goe to Law, iangle and liue at variance? Shall wee that are to heare one truth of God, and receaue one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lye, cog, wrong, hurt each other? or dare we come into the preſence of God in theſe Ordinances, if we walke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately in our courſe?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How are theſe Ordinances begetters and nouriſhers of Communion?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> It is this: That the Lord offring Chriſt to the ſoule, doth not offer him nakedly and barely, but furniſht with all the benefits of his ſatisfaction. So that in this point, we are to conſider what the parcels of thoſe good things are, which the Lord reaches to his Church in the gift of his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>If a Prince come vnder a ſubiects roofe, hee comes not empty and bare, but with all his bounty, and leaues the markes of his preſence behind him. So heere, The Father offring Chriſt, would not haue vs thinke him to be a dry and bare gift, but a rich Cabinet of all choiſe Iewels of good things, that ſo it might be ſtored and enriched by him. This is that which the Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. vrgeth, <hi>Bleſſed bee God, who hath bleſſed vs with all bleſſings in Heauenly places.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2. chap. 1.3. <hi>His Heauenly power hauing ſupplyed vs with all things, tending to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No. For though all are the water that floweth from this welſpring, yet for order ſake, wee ſhall doe well to helpe our conceit thereof with a diſtinction to avoide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuzion.</p>

                  <p>Some of theſe Benefits of Chriſt are concurrent with our firſt ingrafting with him, and accompany our firſt conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and theſe I call benefits concerning a beleeuer, in reſpect of that condition and eſtate of Grace whereto hee is called, and in which hee is ſettled. And theſe concerne this Article to handle.</p>
                  <p>Other are conſequent vpon this condition, as royalties and priuiledges following vpon it, and ſtand not ſo much in the generall calling of a Beleeuer, as in ſpeciall belonging to it: whether inward graces, or outward bleſſings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeuerall promiſes in, and by which God conueies them.</p>
                  <p>And I may well ſay, The former ſort doe conteine the full Right and Title of a Beleeuer, to Chriſt himſelfe: the latter, the poſſeſſion of thoſe good things which iſſue from him, through the whole life, and the diuers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, of which in three Parts.</p>

                  <p>All in ſubſtance are one recouery of an happy eſtate: onely they differ in theſe reſpects.

                  <p>Firſt, the Difference.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, the Nature and vſe of them to our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>As touching the firſt, there is a fourefold difference to bee noted of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſome of them are beforetime, others in time. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And in this reſpect, Election differs from all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>For iuſtification, reconciliation and the reſt, preſuppoſe Chriſt already theirs and iſſue immediatly from him, but Election is before Chriſt himſelfe, and preſuppoſeth nothing but the firſt cauſe of Gods good pleaſure and will. And yet its true, that in Chriſt we enioy all: onely with difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> we are not elected for Chriſt, but we are adopted and reconciled for him.</p>
                  <p>Election being that act of God from all eternity, whereby foreſeeing the ruine of man, hee purpoſed out of his free will to chuſe ſome of thoſe fallen ones, to mercy and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>So that we ſee its one of the benefits of the beleeuer in Chriſt, yet not for Chriſts ſake, but the Fathers, who gaue Chriſt himſelfe to this end, that he might be a foundation of that whereof himſelfe was a firſt cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference is, in reſpect of the benefits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt. In which reſpect, Vocation differs from all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> reſt. For vocation is no fruit of faith as the reſt are, but of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſeeing whom God elected, hee calleth to know it. Calling then is a benefit whereby God brings the ſoule to be capable of all the reſt through faith in the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concernes the elect as they are ſo in God, not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as yet, and ſerues to this end, to make them to know it by faith. But none of the reſt can be wrought in the ſoule without faith, being the fruits of calling to faith, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, adopted, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The third difference is, betweene thoſe benefits of Chriſt, which concerne vs in this life, and thoſe that reach to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:177956:113"/> better. And the difference is great. The former being ſuch as releeue the neceſſity of our preſent condition, in which wee are imperfectly conformed to Chriſt in his eſtate of Humility, and beſet with ſinne, Satan and enemies: of this nature are, our Iuſtification, reconcialiation, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and the like: which all ſhall ceaſe (as faith, hope and patience ſhall) in reſpect of the euils they do heere conflict with: although, out of theſe relations the good of them ſhall abide, as Sonſhip, liberty, amity and the like. But faith in theſe benefits ſhall ceaſe, becauſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with euill ſhall ceaſe, euill, I ſay, both of ſinne and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>Now for thoſe that concerne the life to come in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformity to our Head, they are of another nature, and belong to that image of GOD renued in vs in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and holines, which abide for euer, begun heere in grace, and perfected in glory, Theſe are in themſelues the principall, and faith (howeuer heere its all in all) yet ſerues onely to ſettle this image vpon vs, and hauing brought vs thereto, ſhall ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, and laſt difference is, betweene the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it ſelfe which ſhall abide for euer: and that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if wee conſider the difference betweene the ſtate of an equall image of God to that which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, and that which Chriſt hath purchaſed aboue it as an ouerplus. If hee had onely purchaſed vnto vs, the Image of God, together with immortality, hee had made vs as good as wee were created, though wee had liued on Earth.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe he being no creature, but GOD, tooke our fleſh into himſelfe, that wee might bee as hee is, and where he is; therefore he hath caſt in this ouerplus vnto vs, that in ſtead of an Earthly Paradiſe with old <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhall enioy Heauenly manſions with CHRIST in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and there haue his Image and our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality perfected. But this note, whatſoeuer difference there
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:177956:113"/> be; in this all agree, that they are the worke of the ſpirit of Chriſt ſettling all his benefits vpon the beleeuer.</p>

                  <p>Now this calling is a worke of the Spirit, iſſuing from election, whereby whom the Lord hath chozen to be his, he brings to know it. And that by the voyce and call of the outward word and inward ſpirit, cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then, calling is that whole workmanſhip of GOD, whereby he pulles the ſoule from a bad eſtate to a good: be it longer in working or ſhorter, darker or cleerer
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:177956:114"/> eaſier or harder: its the drawing of it <hi>from darknes to light. Act.</hi> 16.18. That from whence its drawne, is an vnregenerate eſtate. That whereto, is faith. Between theſe, thee whole work of God is calling.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Can you not breefly ſumme vp the parts of it?</hi>

                  <p>The former is that, by which the Lord finding the heart vncapable of a promiſe, brings it and prepares it to be ſuch an one as may ſee it ſelfe capable, and vnder condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, ſuch an one as may beleeue. For, as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of ſuch as imagne that GOD breeds faith all at once, without preparing the heart, they ouerthrow that grace (in reſpect of a ſoules triall of her ſelfe, and in reſpect of Gods Glory) which they would ſeeme to magnify. And they ſtrengthen the hand of ſinful men in their error, thinking there is no difference betweene men; al may beleeue in Chriſt. This by the way.</p>
                  <p>The latter is that by which the Lord doth finiſh the worke of faith and power: which is the Condition of the Goſpell, without which no man can partake any of the priuiledges following.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For it ſucceeds the condition of the Law: and in ſtead of <hi>Do this</hi> fayth, <hi>Beleeue this and liue.</hi> Note well theſe termes: <hi>Preparation is the condition of faith, and faith the condition of the couenant.</hi>

And its the worke of the Spirit of Chriſt, making the Lord and the ſoule <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> and cauſing the ſoule to partake, by vertue thereof, all that power of this, both in priuiledges and graces, which follow. And therefore I ſet it in the forefront of the reſt: for its ſure, the ſoule can no more receaue ought from God, till it bee one with him by Chriſt, then Chriſt could merit any thing for vs, till the Deity and fleſh were really vnited: &amp; no more then the body and ſoule can impart or receaue to or fro, till they be one.

                     <hi>A.</hi> The third is <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> which is the ſecond bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the poore beleeuer, oppoſite to the eſtate of her guilt and puniſhment by ſinne: by which the ſoule ſtands in a full and perfect pardon of ſin, quietneſſe and peace toward God, through his diſcharging her from all guilt and puniſhment: and eſteeming her as fully cleared and acquitted therefrom, as if ſhe had neuer offended.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, but for ſpeciall cauſe, to difference the benefit of Iuſtification from Sanctification: the one being, Chriſt made ours wholy (for we cannot elſe ſtand before God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perfect by our ſelues, or another) the other in part, our Sanctification being in this life imperfect.

                     <hi>A.</hi> The fourth is <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> which is oppozed to our eſtate of enmity, and brings vs into amity and fauour with God, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it our <hi>acceptation</hi> and beloued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>with God,</hi> and it follows our forgiueneſſe and abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for then we returne to our former eſteeme, and beauty in the eyes of God, <hi>our fleſh returning as the fleſh of a child:</hi> and we ſtand before the Lord as fauourits, finding acceſſe to

Now Adoption is the enfranchiſment of the ſoule into her former eſtate of Sonneſhip againe being deliuered from the ſpirit of bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. for as a man takes one, not his owne child to be his child, changing the name into his owne, and ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him the dignity and liuelihood of one deſcended from his loynes: ſo doth the Lord heere: hee reſtores a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his blood, and to his former right of Sonſhip, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the creatures, and coheireſhip with Chriſt the Sonne and Lord of all.</p>
                  <p>It is the fruit of the former. For hauing receiued vs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, he doth as a Prince (reconciled to a trayterous Son) he reſtores him to the right and inheritance of his crowne, and ſo the Lord not reſtores onely to an old, but ſettles the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of a Saint vpon him, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.5.

From hence iſſues an heart enlarged to God, and ſo fearing and ſeruing him,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.6. Col. 3.14.</note> as fearing nothing elſe, nor yet ſeruing in the old letter: deliuered from the ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the traditions of men, the bonds impoſed vpon conſcience vniuſtly.</p>
                  <p>Hence iſſues alſo a right to the Protection of God, and his Holy Hand ouer vs, and ours againſt the treachery and violence of open or ſecret enemies, begun in this life, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the reſurrection, the day of our full redemption, when we ſhall fully enoy the fruit of that conqueſt of Chriſt, who ouercame all enemies, Deuill, men, ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death and the graue, neuer any more to be aſſaulted.

                  <p>It conſiſteth in 2 things: the firſt, the killing power of the Croſſe of Chriſt.

                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing there is no man but will be ready to ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yea; try therefore againe thus, No man is marryed to Chriſt, except he haue his dowry to ſhew.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> neuer ſpeakes of it without wondring.

                  <p>For who thinkes Chriſt to amount to ſuch a ſumme at his firſt beleeuing? Yet the Lord giues him all at once to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.

But when he ſees he hath bought the Lordſhip, and all belonging to it, hee reioyces in his purchaſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, we call that a Church conſtituted, which is ſo gathered together by the Word and profeſſing of the ſame truth, that it doth further enioy the free, peaceable &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled vſe, and adminiſtration of all eſſentials to ſaluation, the Word, Sacraments, and outward Aſſemblies, eſtabliſhed by Chriſtian authority: as bleſſed bee God, this Church doth in which we liue. And contrary to this is that Church, which conſiſts onely in toleration and conniuence doubtfull and vnſettled.</p>
                  <p>A Church Viſible, is an aſſembly of ſuch worſhippers of God, as enioying the liberty of the ordinances, doe partake them, viſibly, audibly, and ſenſibly to the eye and obſeruation of man: ſo that viſibleneſſe doth not looke ſo much at conſtitution, as at externalneſſe of worſhip: a conſtituted Church muſt needs bee viſible, but not <hi>contrà.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church Inuiſible, is that Communalty or fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Elect of GOD, (when or whereſoeuer throughout the World, in all ages and times,) as, being called to GOD, and giuen to CHRIST, become his Myſticall body, and are built vp into one habitation by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>She is called Inuiſible, not as if ſhe conſiſted of ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as may not be ſeene and bodily conuerſed with: ſeeing that they do (vſually) reſide in the Church Viſible, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God with others externally: but becauſe that by which ſhee ſubſiſts, is an Inuiſible grace of the ſpirit, not ſenſible to the eye of man, but knowne to God alone, and to others only by the iudgement of Charity, more or leſſe. So that the next two termes of <hi>Militant</hi> and <hi>Triumphant,</hi> are onely ſpecials of this generall head Inuiſible.</p>
                  <p>The Militant Church being that part of the Inuiſible, which heere vpon earth walketh and warreth with, and for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:177956:120"/> God, againſt all his and her enemies, according to that vow and oath ſhee tooke in her baptiſme, or preſt mony, wherein ſhee couenanted to bee Gods faithfull ſouldier againſt World, Deuill, or Fleſh, and therefore ſhe is that Brood of Trauellers mentioned in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84 &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. that thorow Baca go to Ieruſalem.</p>
                  <p>The Church Triumphant is that Inuiſible, which hauing caſt off her harne is after the Victory obtained, abides in ſoule with God, and triumphs there ouer all conquered enemies. Both theſe (although in diuers ſtate) are the ſame Church, as ſhall appeare, when both ſhall receaue their bodies after the Reſurrection, and make one Spouſe of Chriſt, wherein is neyther ſpot nor wrinkle.</p>
                  <p>Now laſtly, the Church corrupt or malignant is that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall kind of a Church Viſible, which, although it retaines Baptiſme and ſome ſuch truths as are of the eſſence, yet hath degenerated in the moſt of her tenets from the truth of the Goſpell, and therefore howſoeuer, her Baptiſme cannot ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be denied, yet for her eſſentiall corruptions in moſt points of the foundation, eſpecially her malignity againſt the true Church, is to bee for euer ſeparated from by that Church, which ſtill retaineth the purity of doctrine, and integrity of life. And what this Church is, all may conceaue, to wit, That vnder the Papacy.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>I vnderſtand you: Now ſay which of theſe is that which is the equall and onely ſubiect of Chriſt and his Benefits?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Church inuiſible, of which we ſay in the Creed, <hi>I beleeue the Holy Catholique Church.</hi> Onely with this difference, that although the whole Church enioy all: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Triumphant differs from the Militant in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and poſſeſſion, the one by ſence, the other vnder the aſſurance of Faith and Hope, therefore heere we eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aime at the militant, as it containes the whole army of the Souldiers, the body of his members.</p>
                  <p>For as particular ſouldiers make a ranke, and many rankes or companies a legion, and many legions an army: ſo heere.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:177956:121"/> And as many particular viſible congregations, make vp the body of the whole viſible: ſo many particular inuiſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and companies make the whole inuiſible body of the Church Militant.</p>
                  <p>Yet note, the ſoule of this body ſo imparteth it ſelfe to all, that yet each member partakes his part in theſe benefits. See texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Explaine your ſelfe more fully. For yee ſeeme heereby to preiudice the viſible Church. What? Hath not ſhee then any prerogatiue in this behalfe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, euery way, farre be it from vs to conceaue ſuch a groſſe error. I may ſay as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Hers is the Law, the Adoption, the Glory, the Commandements, the Worſhip, the Promiſes.</hi> Nay, from her wombe came forth this Inuiſible company, and at her breſts they ſucked: and beſides, ſecretly in her boſome ſtill doe lye the reſt of the elect, as yet vngathered, yet in due time to be brought to this Fold.</p>
                  <p>We aſcribe as much honour to a Church conſtituted, as can be, and in ſome ſort ſay of her, <hi>Shee is the pillar of truth,</hi> in point of holding forth all the named priuiledges: howbeit in this reſpect of the ſpirituall participation of the benefits of Chriſt, we may not ſay that as ſhe is onely viſible, ſhe can be called the ſubiect heereof.</p>
                  <p>We grant, its one of the greateſt bleſſings in the world, to bee partakers of ſuch a bleſſing, as a viſible Church, and <hi>Bleſſed is that people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Howbeit, to ſay that the Scriptures which ſpeake of theſe Benefits, doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aime at the viſible Church, as when he ſaith, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt her. That ſhe is the pillar of truth: That Christ is made to her Righteouſneſſe, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c.</hi> is very dangerous. For neither to her properly, nor neceſſarily do ſuch promiſes belong.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, not properly, becauſe ſpirituall things cannot bee partaken, but by ſpirituall receiuing and inſtruments: but that which giueth the name to viſible, is onely externall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:177956:121"/> the ſpirituall efficacy of Word and Sacraments, concerneth the elect onely.</p>
                  <p>The Viſible Church (be it neuer ſo perfect) being that of which thoſe parables doe ſpeake: when the Kingdome of Heauen (not the World) is compared to a <hi>field</hi> of <hi>graine,</hi> and of tares or weeds: to the <hi>net</hi> that had good fiſh, or the elect: and hypocrites, that is, reffuſe traſh: that heap which had good wheat and yet more chaffe. It is true that in the Lords accompt the ordinances are giuen to the elect primarily, and to the reſt for their ſake: but in reſpect of the outward Polity of a Viſible Church, the diſpenſation concernes both equally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I adde, not neceſſarily: for the Church Militant had lyen hid for a long time together, as in the times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and confuſion, when ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> was purſued ſo hard ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Pagans or the malignant Church, that ſhe could not enioy ſo much as the Scriptures in their owne tongue, much leſſe the ordinances, ſaue by ſteal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. As the Lord tels <hi>Elia</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 19.18. <hi>I haue reſerued</hi> 7000. <hi>to my ſelfe that haue not bowed the knee to Baal:</hi> and Obadia <hi>hid the Prophets from Ahab and Iezabel, by fifties in a caue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All ſtories record what a Catalogue of witneſſes the Lord hath had by thoſe Martyrs, Confeſſors and Beleeuers, ſince the primitiue times, till now: &amp; how God not only ſtill had this Number (when viſibil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Was not that the Church of God, of which we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35 36, 37? Yet not viſible: for <hi>they were tortured, had triall of cruell mockings, ſcourgings, b nds and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſawne, ſlaine with the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ord, wandred in ſheeps skins and Goates skins, deſtitute and afflicted. Of whom the world was not worthy.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. ſaith, <hi>Though Iſrael were as the ſand of the Sea, yet a remnant onely ſhall be ſaued. Not all of Iſrael are Gods Iſrael. He is not a Iew,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:177956:122"/> who is of the letter, but of the Spirit, whoſe prayſe is of God, not of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I conclude:</hi> Although it be the greateſt bleſſing heere to the Church of Chriſt, that ſhe enioy her viſible ordinances with peace and conſtitution: yet in this reſpect ſhe is not the Depoſitary of theſe ſpirituall benefits, but in reſpect of her vnuiſible frame by vocation and vnion.</p>

She hath all light <hi>&amp; defence here, and in Heauen the Lambe himſelfe ſhall be her Sunne and</hi> glory: <hi>She ſhall bee ledde into all truth, Her ſayth ſhall not fayle.

All which ſhew the truth of this, that as Chriſt was the Fathers Treaſure of wiſedome and grace, ſo the Church in him her head: for looke what is his, is hers, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> and <hi>ye Chriſts, and Christ gods.</hi> Yea the promiſes made to Chriſt himſelfe, are applyed to her. Compare <hi>Eſay.</hi> 49.8. with that in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>Now it is time to proceed to the vſe: what is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Very plentifull.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, its confutation of the vſurped and pretended title
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:177956:122"/> of the Pſeudo catholique Popiſh Church, who clayme to themſelues this priuiledge to be the Treaſury of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſt. Theirs (they ſay) are the Scriptures; the Word, the Sacraments, the ordination of Miniſters; all the glory is theirs: they are the Ancient, Generall, Apoſtolical Church: al ſucceſſion of Biſhops, al miracles, Counſels theirs: the world is beholding to them for the truthes cuſtody, and they haue proſpered when all other Churches haue peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But Oh ye vſurpers, ſtay a while, and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be granted ye to be a Church at all! If it be, yet ſure a corrupt, malignant one. For what common viſible adminiſtrations do abide with you? what truth haue ye not defiled? eſpecially the maine one, of the Satiſfaction of Chriſt, and free iuſtification of a ſinner? The Scriptures ye haue loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in a ſtrange tongue. The doctrine ye haue marr'd by your traditions: the Miniſtry of Reconciliation ye turne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a preaching of fables, or rayling againſt Proteſtants: the Sacraments ye haue partly corrupted, as Baptiſme, partly abandoned, as the Supper (by your Maſſe Sacrifice) and partly oppreſſed with an heap of your owne. If any Viſiblenes be among you, its viſible worſhip of bread, of a Rood, of a Virgin aboue GOD himſelfe, of God in the ſhape of an old man, of Saints more then God himſelfe. Your viſible Idolatries, crueltyes and bloodſhed of Saints, your viſible Stewes, your viſible adulteries, blaſphemies, &amp; vices argue ye the ſucceſſors rather of thoſe Prieſts, Phariſes and Sadduces in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, then of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles. Therefore as <hi>Peter</hi> (whoſe chaire ye claime falſely) ſayd to <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> ſo we to you in point of the Treaſury of <hi>Chriſts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, <hi>Ye haue no part or fellowſhip in theſe things;</hi> And that Treaſury of Saints merits ye dreame of, the Church of God knowes not, but ſayth, <hi>Wee haue not enough to ſell, leſt wee ſhould haue too little for our ſelues;</hi> Gods treaſure is not wanting in neceſſaryes, yet not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Therefore ye are a malignant Church, and that whereof the Scripture ſpeakes, <hi>Come out of her, my people, and her ſinnes, leſt ye taſte of her plagues.</hi>

                  <p>Stryue to be of that number of which ye heard, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. and doe not reſt till ye be come to that Church, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the <hi>Spirits of iuſt men, of Ieſus the Mediator of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,</hi> and <hi>the blood of sprinkling that ſpeakes better things then that of Abel.</hi> Bleſſe God for thoſe viſible helpes, which yee enioy of the Word and Sacraments: but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in theſe, the Lord conueyeth the benefits of Chriſt, <hi>which none knoweth,</hi> but the ſoule <hi>that hath them, Reuel.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>Beware leſt the contempt of theſe viſible and audible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; one day ſo vexe ye, that ye wiſh ye had neither ſeen, nor heard them. Your condition is beſt or worſt: beſt, if ye
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:177956:123"/> beleeue theſe promiſes, and cleaue to theſe prerogatiues, If they bring ye to the hope of Chriſt for a better life: but elſe moſt miſerable. See and apply that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. I ſay, take heed leaſt euen that ye haue be not quite remooued, light and candleſticks, Goſpel and al, for your Laodicean fulnes. Empty your ſoules of their glut, leſt the Lord ſtreighten his Spirit &amp; take away the power of his truths. Remember, theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priuiledges ſerue to ſettle the inuiſible vpon ye. Boaſt not of the Temple, the Temple: that is holy; but ſee that it hallow you alſo: and that the Word preached, and the ſeales of Grace added to it, doe imprint vpon you the benefits of vnion with Chriſt, iuſtification from ſinne, adoption of ſons, redemption from ſlauery to Satan, your luſts and the error of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Theſe benefits none ſaue the elect can partake. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, yee may bee long vnder the one, and yet bee led away from the other, by the corrupt manners of the time, the error of the wicked, and cuſtome of ſinne, and ſlights of the Deuill.</p>
                  <p>Take heed that the coldneſſe of the age, and abundance of iniquity, cauſe ye not to fayle of that inuiſible grace, which the Goſpel offers ye: but know, that one priuiledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueies another. Stop not the <hi>wels of ſaluation,</hi> play not the hypocrites, to whom theſe ſtreames of the oyle and butter of the ordinances of Chriſt neuer flow vnto, through your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, <hi>Iob</hi> 20.57. But if ye obtaine vocation and vnion by them, then <hi>bleſſed are your eyes, for they haue ſeene, and eares, for they haue heard the things which concerne your peace, which others neuer ſaw:</hi> and yet are happier in not ſeeing, then ye in ſeeing and not beleeuing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſolation to the true Church of Chriſt, for her <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>4</label> portion of theſe benefits giuen her in Chriſt. Wonder that the Lord ſhould ſo looke vpon the lowlineſſe of thy poore, deſpiſed ſtate in the world, as to make thee his Iewel-houſe of theſe treaſures.</p>
                  <p>If but of one of them, much more of all. Let this doctrine vrge that in the former Article. Let each member of this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:177956:124"/> Church, praiſe God for her portion fallen into ſo good a ground. Wiſh not that it had fallen otherwiſe any way, no not to be a Treaſurer of a Prince without it.</p>
                  <p>Let thoſe precious names, praiſes and promiſes vphold thee in all times of reproch and diſdaine by ſuch as know thee not. If they knew thy treaſure, <hi>ten men would take thee by the skirt, Zach.</hi> 8. <hi>vlt.</hi> and ten women would come to thee, to beare their name. <hi>Although thou art blacke and haſt lyen among the pots, yet thou art comely in Gods eye,</hi> his doue, ſiſter, darling: and although thy iewels are ſullyed a little with the aſperſions of enemies, yet when God ſhall make them vp, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. they ſhall caſt their luſtre, and then ſhall it appeare who are precious, when they are ſeparated from the vile.</p>
                  <p>Hold therefore thy right, and ſell not thy birthright for whatſoeuer the Deuill would offer thee, to cozen thee of it. Redemption is thine, therefore liberty; ſtand faſt in it: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation thine, therefore amity and fauor: iuſtification thine, therefore peace: Adoption thine, therefore acceſſe to God in prayer: and ſo of the reſt: hold theſe as thy life, and part with none of them, except Chriſt himſelfe the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of them by his blood, bee of no price with thee: nor let time cauſe them to waxe ſtale, but each day let theſe bee more precious, as being effects and proofes of thy calling and vnion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The body holdes the members, the vine, the branches, not they them. Bee not highminded, but humble thy ſelfe and bee leſſer then the meaneſt of the members.

                  <p>As no member hath all the gifts of the reſt: ſo it hath the ſupply of all, if it abide in the body. Let it cauſe thy ſoule to be knit to the leaſt members for the grace of it; let the whole body (compounded of all) bee glorious in thine eye, and ſay as <hi>Huſhai</hi> once did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Hee whom the King and his people ſhall chuze, ſhall be my delight alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold the Graces of GOD in her: get diſcerning of them, for ſhee is all glorious within, and her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide may deceaue thee.

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is it to beleeue this?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the worke of the Spirit of God, by vertue of which, a ſoule vnder the condition of fayth, doeth caſt it ſelfe and rely vpon the offer of God, for pardon of ſin and for eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>I ſee ſome things in your anſwer to be difficult: as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the two latter: for, as I freely grant faith to be the gift God wrought by his Spirit, ſo I would faine know what you meane by thoſe two latter, viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I will endeauor it. And for the former (as before in the point of Vocation, I ſhewed what I meane by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of faith:) ſo briefly I anſwer, it is ſuch a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as God requires of one who may beleeue the promiſe of reconciliation to belong to him.</p>
                  <p>True it is, if wee looke at the power of God, he could in a moment ſet a man in ſtate of grace out of the ſtate of corruption: but in this wee muſt looke at his will reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and what is moſt agreeable to the ſpirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
                  <p>The Lord knowes, it is no eaſy thing to beate a man out of himſelfe, when the ſence of his burden lyes vpon him: therefore he ſo prepares him, that he ſhall not deny but that he meanes him well, euen when he deſerues leaſt. And ſurely it ought not to ſeeme ſo ſtrange a point, if wee weigh the Scriptures, which neuer ſpeake in any other language. We read in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and 13.1. that when the Lord would <hi>ſet open a fountaine to his Church for ſin and tranſgreſſion,</hi> he firſt put into them <hi>the Spirit of grace,</hi> and compaſſions or <hi>Supplications,</hi> cauſing them to <hi>ſee him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:177956:126"/> whom they had pierced,</hi> and mourne bitterly.</p>
                  <p>If we ſee the fulfilling heereof in the Goſpell, wee ſhall find that this <hi>Spirit of mourning</hi> went before faith as a preparatiue: Reade <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. when thoſe murtherers of CHRIST heard that he was the Lord of life, who offred life vnto them by <hi>Peter: they were pricked in their heart, ſaying, Men and Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Repent and beleeue.</hi> Read theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conditions of fayth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are they who thirſt:</hi> they who <hi>are poore in ſpirit, they that mourne:</hi> for <hi>theirs is the kingdome,</hi> they <hi>ſhall be ſatiſfied; and Mat.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Come to me all that are loden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> What thinke we? are not theſe conditions of a thing as yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? to wit, of beeing <hi>comforted, eaſed and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like I may ſay of that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. touching <hi>Seeking God:</hi> I will doe this for them, (pardon them) yet <hi>I will be ſought for it by them.</hi> So that its playne, that the Lord meaning to bring the ſoule to beleeue, prepares it firſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is it which workes theſe preparations? is it any other thing in the world then that which worketh fayth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No doubtleſſe. The Spirit of grace accompanying the offer of GOD in the Goſpell, doth worke both in the ſoule: howbeit by degrees, the former at the firſt, and the latter after: and that according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of enlightening &amp; perſwaſion which the ſoule is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
                  <p>As wee ſee in deepe Melancholy and Sorrow, that which at the firſt ſeemes harſh and cannot be endured: yet by degrees the Spirit is glad to embrace, In the morning, wee ſee there is more light comming from the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:177956:126"/> So here. The offer of Chriſt to the ſoule, and the goodnes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the offrer, doth imprint in the ſoule ſome ſteps and prints of it, in a more remote degree; as to ſee a poſſibility of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſtay the ſoule from faynting: when yet it is farre from reſting in it. And as the Spirit addes more light and ſauor of it, ſo it workes the heart to the making more toward it, (if ſome barre of Satan, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption let not) as by mourning for that ſinne which offended ſuch a good GOD, although yet I apply not this goodnes: and ſo by deſiring it to bee my portion, and ſeeing all other things to be droſſe to it: and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme is, the Lord by theſe meanes enlarges the heart more and more to thinke, that mercy to belong to her, which ſhe feeles to be dayly preſented in more orient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and to be the offer of him, that needed not to offer it, and whereof ſhe feeles more and more need: ſo that as the purpoſe of God appeares more cleerly to it, ſo the timorous ſoule makes neerer and neerer to it, till it come to rely it ſelfe at laſt vpon it. And who feeles not the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this in himſelfe, that as light encreaſes, ſo the ſoule is bolder to venture, and feeles eft one ſtep, eft another to be wrought, of hope, ſtay, good affections of ſorrow, of deſire, when yet ſhe dare not iudge ſuch a Iewell as mercy to be her portion.</p>
                  <p>And to end this, what our ſence may conclude in the ſcattering of darknes, by degrees in the aire vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of light, although till the Sunne riſe, the day is not perfect: the like may bee ſayd heere in the wanzing of feares more and more, by the approach of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when yet the day ſtarre of righteouſnes is not riſen.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But I obſerue, that many doubt of this for ſundry cauſes: firſt they obiect,</hi> Nothing can pleaſe GOD with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: <hi>now its ſure Godly ſorrow and deſire pleaſe God: and therefore what need wee ſeeke a further way, when
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:177956:127"/> Faith may be ſaid to containe them all? How anſwer you this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I ſay this, It pleaſeth God that theſe ſteps toward Faith, be wrought in the ſoule, though I deny that they (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eaſe God as acts proceeding therefrom.</p>
                  <p>For there are three acts of the Spirit in them that heare.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, a meere common worke which hypocrites may haue.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, a gracious ſauing worke, as faith proper to the Elect.</p>
                  <p>The third, I take to be a middle worke, which as it is not grace formally, ſo neyther is it a common worke: but ſuch a worke of the Spirit, as ſtands in order to faith, certainly following: and this is good, in reſpect of that it produceth, to with Grace it ſelfe, which ſhall not bee hindred, but perfited in due time. And of this ſort are theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Now to make theſe the worke of Faith, is inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: for although a ſoule to bee conuerted, hath a ſeed of Grace, remotely caſt in by the Spirit, which ſhall be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: yet how abſurd were it to ſay, That a man hath that which hee mournes for the want of, or which hee deſires to haue, I ſay, in that reſpect, in which hee mournes and deſires it? otherwiſe I doe not doubt, but where there is true Faith, there may bee a mourning after more.</p>
                  <p>It is obiected, Faith may be and not diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, For a time it may, and in ſome degree or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation holding vnder, but not in an habited and ſettled manner of abſence.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What ſay you to the ſecond doubt? This opinion ſeemes to croſſe a truth, That conuerſion is wrought in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I deny it not by this aſſertion: for as it is in the wombe, that there are ſome preparations naturall in the fruit, to make it meet for the ſoule, to enter with the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening power of it, and yet that onely is the being of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:177956:127"/> creature: ſo theſe ſteps wrought in the ſoule before faith, are not faith, but the conuerſion of the ſoule to God, is in the onely act of faith, in which the work of calling is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and not afore.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Dispatch the reſt; The third doubt is, that the worke of the Law, is preparatiue enough for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So it is, for the doctrine of the Goſpell to bee offred to it. But note by the way, how this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction grants a legall preparation; Why not others alſo?</p>
                  <p>But briefly I anſwer, That it is falſe: for the Law ſerues not to breake the heart, or open and melt it, although it doe batter and ſubdue the fierceneſſe of it in generall: now the Scripture vrgeth other preparation, and humiliation vnto Faith.</p>
                  <p>For it is as impoſſible to mould the broken gobbets of a veſſell into a new one without melting, as the heart vnder legall terror into a beleeuing one, without ſome diſpoſitions of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But the laſt doubt is greateſt: that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine fauoureth Popiſh preparation, to our owne conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: teaching to attaine to grace by ſomewhat within our ſelues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This hath a colour in it, and nothing elſe. For who euer aſcribed theſe to any thing in vs? Doe wee not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the free offer of grace doth make the heart ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, tender and capable of grace, as well as ſtampe the heart with it by faith?</p>
                  <p>Both come from the Goſpell, and ſo doth all belonging to reconciliation: the warp and the woof of the cloth, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning to preuent and hold on, and the finiſhing of it, come from thence. Onely one thing I adde. It is true that many hearers doe make it a tedious way to themſelues, through their owne error.</p>
                  <p>For they thinke that the Goſpell vrgeth theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith, as workes of our owne prediſpoſing
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:177956:128"/> our ſelues, and ſo ayme at them, that they bringing them to God, might take the ware for laying downe the pryce.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, when they feele their Selfe-louing affections mooue them to mourne, to deſire, to pray, to deny ſome ſinnes, and occaſions, they thinke Faith is not farre off: and thereupon (for the time) none are ſo hopefull as they.</p>
                  <p>But when they feele their hearts neuer the freer or quieter heereby, but old ſlauery to abide ſtill, they are at a plunge, and ſo wanze away like ſhadowes.</p>
                  <p>But theſe men muſt conſider, the Lord offers not grace vpon ſuch carnall termes. That which the ſoule ſhould look at in her preparation, is not any of her owne welfare and ends by beleeuing, as thinking thereby to ſtop many feares, or to get ſome aduantage to an eaſie Religion: but the glory of GOD ſimply, in the entertayning of his rich grace: which ſhee ought to ſet vp aboue her owne Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, that which God aymes at in offring mercy, is the magnifying of his attributes of Mercy, Iuſtice, Wiſedome and the reſt, which hee will haue more to appeare in mans Redemption, then they could in <hi>Adam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> integrity.</p>
                  <p>Hee will haue the eternall doores open themſelues, as hee ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. <hi>vlt.</hi> not that our owne ende, forgiueneſſe, and happineſſe, but the King of glory might inter in. Euen as he ordained our Lord Ieſus not to obey and ſuffer for any ends of his owne: but meerely the Fathers, to whom he was ſubiect: as we ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3.</p>
                  <p>And therefore he would haue him loſe all glory, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelfe, that hee might fulfill the ends of him that ſent him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4, 5. If the Lord required this of his owne Son, what ſhall he doe to vs, who ſtand bound to it?</p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle neuer ſpeakes of the myſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in any of his Epiſtles, as in that of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.5. and others: but hee preſſeth this, that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:177956:128"/> the Lord aimed <hi>at the manifeſting of the riches of his glorious grace,</hi> and of all his attributes, in the ſauing of a ſinner.</p>
                  <p>So that when this end of God (as much beyond our ends, as the ſun is aboue the earth) is once ſeene into, it carryes the heart more from it owne, then <hi>Sauls</hi> father, when hee turned the care for the Aſſes, into the care for his ſonne.</p>
                  <p>And as Mariners take all the thought how they may row their maine Ship, but as for the ſmall Boates they tye them to that, to follow the motion thereof alone: ſo, if wee could ſee what the ſtreame of God were in CHRIST, and the offer of Saluation, it would quite driue vs out of our ſelues and ſelfeloues, and tye them to his ſhip to follow it: that if the Lord hauing his glory from vs, we may alſo under him obtaine ſaluation, we may be glad: and aſcribe the glory of his holy way and deuice of Chriſts pardon and ſaluation to him alone, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. that he who boaſteth, might boaſt of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Oh, how would this drown all ſelfeloue in his ſtreame? and how ſhould our mournings be after him, and our deſires for him, and our affections toward him, preferring him to our owne ſaluation as <hi>Paul</hi> did Iſraels? The ignorance of this hath brought in a baſe and degenerate endeauor in moſt men, to ſeeke faith, and ſo keepes them alway in their extremities. But I forbeare.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Can you ſay any more to prooue this, that ſo yee may adde a little touching the things wherein this preparation ſtands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is ſaid by <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.3, 4. and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.3. that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was ſent in all auſterity to prepare the people to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, ſorrow, and ſelfedeniall: as that charge implyeth, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdome of Heauen</hi> (meaning forgiueneſſe) <hi>is at hand.</hi> Which repenting was not a conuerſion to God before remiſſion came: but a preparing of the ſoule by godly ſorrow and ſenſibleneſſe of ſinne, to prize mercy approaching. As thoſe words following doe witneſſe, <hi>Euery valley ſhalbe
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:177956:129"/> filled, and each hill caſt downe, euery crooked thing made straight,</hi> and ſo forth, which ſignifieth nothing elſe, but a preparing of an vntoward heart by humiliation, to beleeue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Like to which is that, <hi>Plow vp your fallow grounds, and ſow not among thornes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to leaue proofes, that I aime at in a few words, is to bring to my Auditors view in two or three lines, the ſumme of many Sermons, touching the maner of this Euangelicall preparation.</p>
                  <p>And thus conceaue it: that where the Lord will worke kindly, he will ſo preſent the glory of his grace to the ſoule in diſtreſſe, that whereas before it was vnder confuſed deſpaire, now it ſhall ſee a creuis of light, and an hope (a farre off) of a poſſible deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Which hope ſhall melt and diſſolue the heart into a Spirit of mourning and breaking of heart, not ſo much for feare of Hell, as for the Lord himſelfe. See it in <hi>Iona</hi> 3. compare ver. 9. with ver. 6.7, 8. when hope once began to ſpring vp ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Who can tell whether God will repent him of his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> Lo, they melt into teares of blood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, they faſt, put on ſackcloth on themſelues and their beaſts, and make a ruefull ſpectacle.</p>
                  <p>So doth the ſoule heere leaue taking thought for it ſelfe, &amp; take thought for the Lord, ſaying, Oh, wofull man that I am, whom the Lord ſhould be found of, when I ſought him not? who had care of my happineſſe, when I cared neither for him nor my ſelfe? Oh, now the ſoule ſees ſtrange ſights, which was blind before.</p>
                  <p>Now it ſees patience in the Lords offer, and ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3. If thou hadſt taken me in my riot, vncleanneſſe, raking vp heapes to my ſelfe, hypocriſie, ſecurity, ciuility, and pitcht mee into hell in my impenitency, thou hadſt beene iuſt, &amp; I had my mends in my owne hands.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, it ſees bounty in God all the long time of ignorance, and wonders that the Lord ſhould endure ſuch a wretch (ſo ſtole in ſinne old and new) to treade vpon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay more, that Spirit of thy grace to dryue them home, to preſent them really to me, &amp; conuince me of thy faithfulnes! Oh, theſe do euen powre out the heart into ſorrow, which was dead and ſhut vp before! When the Lord is inſtant, and deales as if the ſoule ſhould be the gainer! Oh it makes it confeſſe, that the violation of ſuch grace by contempt, is the moſt fearfull wickednes in the world. This is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after the Lord, and to ſee him whome hee hath pierced.</p>

Oh, this way of God in Chriſt is amiable to the ſoule, and it wiſhes that not onely <hi>her head were a fountein of teares,</hi> but the heart alſo of zeale, loue, and deſire after it, and the prayſing of God for it, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17. Oh happy man, if I might euer taſt ſo much of it as might make ſongs of their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance!

                     <hi>A.</hi> It laſtly empties the ſoule of her ſelfe.

So doth the Lord in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Hee cauſes that lothnes and reſiſtance of that proud heart that ſauors no grace or fayth, to quaile and faile vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, takes away that corrupt ſelfe and ſelfeloue which is offended at his grace. And as the Word of the Prophet bidding <hi>Naaman</hi> waſh and bee cleane, being once dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, draue him out of his humors and diſtempers: ſo the brightnes of this grace offred to the ſoule, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure the oppoſition thereof.

                  <p>And therefore in all theſe, ſhe is humbled in her ſelfe and naked, as one that is no better then ſhe was in point of deſert: though in the way of ſaluation much neerer. And therefore ſhe ſayth with the Church. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3.

                  <p> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> Firſt, this is <hi>terror</hi> to all that dreame their eſtate to be good, when yet they lie in their ſins whole men: they thinke Chriſt is offred them barely, <hi>Be reconciled to God:</hi> be they what they will be.</p>
                  <p>And in this they are the more ſtrengthened by the opinion of ſuch Diuines as diſlike theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. I confeſſe then indeed, this is a bad
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:177956:131"/> fruit of it, and yet the beſt that I haue found to come from it.</p>
                  <p>But to paſſe by them: to theſe I ſay, Beware leſt ye play the deſpizers of grace ſo long <hi>(by turning it to wantonneſſe)</hi> while the LORD leaues yee to vaniſh and periſh in your owne error and euils.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to all ſuch as remaine blind and dead-hearted blocks in the midſt of this grace of the Goſpell: They ſee no light, nor feele any warmth therefrom: but ſtill are cold ſnakes, and are neyther affected with good nor euill: neither hope, ſorrow, deſire or eſtimation of this pearle will faſten on them.</p>
                  <p>At the heare-ſay of a bargaine, at the noiſe of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and at their jigs and tales they can laugh: but heere, neither will good day mend, nor bad paire them. Where is the hope of your faith, where no dram of the condition of it is wrought?</p>
                  <p>Conſider, at death, ye ſhall heare God ſaying thus, Lo, the things which your hearts loued, ye haue: and if my grace and offer had beene as precious as a baſe pot of beere, as a game at cardes, as a long locke at your eares, ye had alſo had that. But now your knocking at my doore is too late, who heard not my knockings at yours.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all dallyers with the ſeaſon of this grace, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters off this rich offer of God, pind on their ſleeue: thinking that they might haue God tyed to them, and becauſe they haue taſted of his grace, with the tip of their tongue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may haue it at their command: whereas hauing once deſpized it, they grow further and further from it dayly.</p>
                  <p>They ſhould haue learned that the condition of faith is the preparation to faith: dally with the one, and forgo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Alſo all hypocrites that reſt in ſome appearance of theſe preparations, not wrought in them by the Spirit of grace, but from their owne principles: which appeares in this, that if they be reprooued, they cannot endure it, dare not enter into the tryall of their mournings, deſires, and prooue them
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:177956:132"/> to come from the Spirit of grace, but loue their owne eaſe, better then the rules of God, &amp; while their owne pangs laſt, who but they? but when their owne ſparkles be out, then full of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>No conſtancy, playnneſſe, felfedeniall can be found in them: grace is nothing worth of it ſelfe, except ſome mixture of their owne concu re with it. A ſigne that they haue felt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſweetneſſe in it, and therefore are farre from beleeuing it.</p>
                  <p>Oh, loſe not your labour, <hi>lay not out your mony for no bread:</hi> chuſe not to goe a mile with God for nothing, rather then two for ſaluation: let Gods glory bee aboue your ſelues, and loſe not all for a falſe heart, but take his counſell, that ſaid, 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Loſe not the things yee haue ſwet for,</hi> till yee haue got a full reward, euen Faith to ſaue your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Secondly &amp; laſtly, exhortation to poore ſoules, whom God hath truly brought vnder the condition of faith, to bleſſe him for that handſell.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, firſt to acknowledge it great mercy, although they haue many doubts, and feares, and diſtempers to hinder them, and the Deuill to come between cup and lip, that they might not drink of this cup of ſaluation. Oh remember, its mercy to be brought within theſe Suburbes of Heauen: If ye deſire, ſay not, Its nothing.</p>
                  <p>It was wont to be the anſwer of a diſcontented woman, who had enough; when ſhee was asked how ſhe fared, to anſwere, We haue nothing, &amp;c. This whining heart is in vs, and hinders vs from much good. Be thankefull for any thing, eſpecially a pledge of faith: nay, be humble and ſay, Lord, what euer is not Hell, is from mercy.</p>
                  <p>I will rather comfort my ſelfe, that the Lord meanes mee the fulneſſe of this earneſt: rather then grudge that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I haue not my will, and ſo waxe weary of wayting.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, ſhould expell ſlauiſh feare from them, becauſe the Lord hath giuen them a condition of faith. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware ye doe not abuſe it.</p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:177956:132"/>
                  <p>Pledges are well kept by honeſt men, not ſpoiled. Do not tempt God by your diſtruſt: nor ſuffer the good preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit to dye or wanze, through boldneſſe, looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, worldlineſſe, pleaſures leſt God make them as bitter to yee, as <hi>Samſons</hi> dallyings with his harlot. If yee belong to God, he will ſaue ye: but it ſhall be thorow the fire, and with ſome ſmart, ere the Deuill and your conſcience haue done wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h ye.</p>
                  <p>It is in this caſe as with them that play at Slyde-groat: the ſiluer at firſt may bee eaſily diſcerned by the ſtamp, but by that time they haue vſed it at the pleaſure a while, is ſo defaced yee that know not what to make of it.</p>
                  <p>Make conſcience of keeping Gods pledges, ſafe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. And to conclude, let theſe conditions already wrought, bee encouragements to attend the LORD for Faith it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>When a <hi>Manoa</hi> told his Wife, they muſt dye, becauſe they had ſeene GOD: ſhee rather argued contrarily, that if GOD would ſlay them, hee would neuer haue told them of a ſonne: for how could this and that ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  <p>Nay wait vpon God, and preſſe vpon him by prayer, to performe his promiſe vpon this condition. <hi>Eliſha</hi> being to forgo his Maſter, asked him that his ſpirit might be doubled vpon him: <hi>Elia</hi> told him it was hard to grant: howbeit if he ſaw him at their parting, he ſhould. Now what did <hi>Eliſha?</hi> did he ſtart from him? Could any thing deuide him? No, he would be ſure to keep the condition of the grant: and ſo did. For ſeeing <hi>Elia</hi> to aſcend, he cryed, <hi>My father, my father, the Horſemen of Iſrael and the Chariots thereof:</hi> and ſo in taking vp the cloake of his Maſter, hee recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Spirit doubled. Oh, that this wiſedome were in vs?</p>
                  <p>Rather the ſinne of our hearers is, after they haue ſpent a great part of their life, in getting the condition, they are ſo farre from heartening themſelues to beleeue that God will
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:177956:133"/> perfect the worke of faith with power, that they are ready to float betweene theſe two, the Condition, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
                  <p>If they be vrged to beleeue, they fly to the condition, ſaying yea, if I had the condition, but I am farre from mourning, &amp;c. If they be vrged to the condition, then they anſwer, yea, if I could beleeue: as if theſe were works of our owne, not the Lords, rather the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other, then agreeable.</p>
                  <p>I end therefore with this caueat, Let not the Deuill deceaue thee about thy condition, and then hold what thou haſt, and let nothing ſo beguile thee as to deny Gods grace: and ſo doing, plead with the Lord humbly, that he would not fruſtrate thy hope, of which hee hath giuen thee ſuch a pledge, and in his beſt ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil aſſuredly anſwer thee.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Now come to the latter branch. What is it, to caſt the ſoule vpon a promiſe, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the laſt worke of the Calling Spirit of GOD, wherby an humbled ſinner doth caſt himſelfe vpon this Word of God, <hi>Be reconciled, come and drinke, come and I will eaſe you</hi> (or the like offer, will charge or promiſe of God) for pardon and life. This point is of all others the chiefe, and therefore I choze to refer it to this place, as the vſe of all that hath beene ſpoken ioyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: for wee know, a fiuefold cord is not eaſily broken, and yet no one twiſt thereof might well bee ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Fiue diuers grounds haue beene handled in this ſecond part.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God the Father our enemy hath cut off his plea, and found out our deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Lord Ieſus accordingly hath ſatiſfied the iuſtice of God, that mercy might haue free courſe by the procuring of a righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God the Father accepts this for a poore ſinner
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:177956:133"/> as if hee in perſon had ſatiſfied, and therefore offers it to the ſoule moſt vnfeignedly, without hooke or crooke.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He offers him not nakedly, but with all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his rich furniture, to draw the ſoule to faſten vpon him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He offers him to each poore member of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Church, there to dwell for euer both in grace and Glory. Now conclude, I demand what one linke of all this chaine were not ſtrong enough to draw the heart to ſettle it ſelfe vpon it? And yet I muſt ſay this, That the Word &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God is the immediate thing which faith relyes vpon: although ſtrengthened with all the reſt. A little therefore of the nature of this promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many things are required to this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two in generall. The one to gage the promiſe and offer of God, as a mariner would ſound the depth of the Sea, leſt his ſhip ſhould be on ground; to ſee whether it be able to beare the weight of the ſoule or no, and anſwer all her diſtempers and feares fully. The ſecond, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that it is able to ſuſteine it, then to rely and caſt it ſelfe vpon it confidently, for her owne pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall the ſoule rightly gage the depth and ſtrength of the offer and promiſe, which it cannot reach?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Although the mariner cannot himſelfe by his owne fadom touch the bottome of the Sea, yet by his line and plummet hee can ſound it as well, as if hee could reach it with his hand, and ſo faſten his Anchor vpon it: ſo heere the plummet and cable of the Word, wherein this ſtrength and depth lyes, will helpe vs to find it out ſo farre as may ſerue our turne. The hand of fayth touches the depth of mercy conteined in the offer, by the direction of the Spirit in the Word, which tells vs what is contained therein.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:177956:134"/>
                  <p>Q <hi>How many things are conteyned in it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Many things: of which by the way I gaue a touch in Article three, but heere I will open further. Looke thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſee what I ſayd of the freedome and Simplicity of the offer. Now adde more touching the nature of the Word of promiſe, which is Gods expreſſion of the offer at the full. Three things then the ſoule muſt looke at, to bottome it ſelfe vpon the promiſe of Reconciliation and deliuerance. Firſt, The wiſedome of the Lord. Secondly, The ſtrength. Thirdly, The faythfulnes: all which as ſure grounds the Lord hath hidden in the promiſe of mercy to a poore ſinner, that is vnder the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the firſt the wiſedome of GOD in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I may ſay of it, as the Holy Ghoſt ſayd of <hi>Salomon,</hi> when hee called for a Sword to cut the Child. <hi>All Iſrael ſawe that God hath put the ſpirit of wiſedome into him to doe iustice.</hi> So, God hath ſhewed all wiſedome in the promiſe, to ſettle the ſoule. And that in two reſpects: firſt, of himſelfe: ſecondly, of vs: In reſpect of himſelfe, becauſe in reuealing his heart of loue to the ſoule onely heerby, and no other way, he teacheth vs, that he who is God onely wiſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. could in the depth of his counſell find out no other way ſo wiſe and ſufficient as this, to ground the ſoule in ſure peace towards him: Chriſt and the promiſe in him, was that which ſeemed the wiſeſt of all wayes, in the thought of God, eſpecially to vs vnder the Goſpell. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>After ſundry wayes the Lord ſpake to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in darke times, as dreames, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, viſions: but now by his Sonne and Word, the engrauen forme, &amp;c.</hi> Note how this courſe is called the beſt, and wiſeſt, and holdingeſt of all, as hauing more in it then all the reſt. Oh! we would thinke in our ſhallownes, that <hi>one from the dead,</hi> Angels or reuelations were better. But wiſedome it ſelfe hath pitcht vpon this way (all things conſidred) as the wiſeſt of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:177956:134"/>
                  <p>Secondly, in reſpect of vs: For it is ſuche way as call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> vs to fayth: a promiſe hauing relation to beleeuing it, without wch it cannot profit vs. Now, if it bee without vs how w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e a way is it to quaſh and dampe our baſe ſpirit of Selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and ſelfe endeauor, and to abaſe our pride, that he who boaſteth, might boaſt in the Lord? So that the promiſe is like the Map which a wiſe man ſhewed once to a foole that boaſted of his Lands, bidding him to point out his Lands in the Map: which beeing narrow, hee could not doe. And ſo went away aſhamed. Note then for this, firſt, wee all would bee compted wiſe: many in theſe daies chuze to be compted rather diſhoneſt then vnwiſe. Well, let vs then be wiſe for our ſelues, and wiſe to ſaluation in ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing this way of a promiſe to ground our ſoules vpon. We ſee not the Lord: but if this be a wiſer way then that, thinke there is ſomewhat in it more then at firſt might ſeeme, and faſten vpon it.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What is the ſecond bottome in a promiſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Strength of God: Read. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael cannot lye:</hi> meaning, in his Word. So then in the Word of GOD is his ſtrength alſo, enough to beare vp the poore ſoule in beleeuing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He beares vp all</hi> (the weight of the world) <hi>by the Word of his power:</hi> how much more the weight of a weake ſoule? See <hi>Eſay.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Anger is not in mee,</hi> there is a word. What followes? <hi>Or take hold of my ſtrength and make peace.</hi> q.d. If I bee reconciled, there is ſtrength enough in that for a ſinner to take hold of: eyther this or nothing. Read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>for all the promiſes of God in him are Yea and Amen:</hi> that is, ſure and ſtrong; but marke how? <hi>In him:</hi> the <hi>words that I ſpeake, are, Spirit and life.</hi> But wherein is this ſtrength? Surely in the forenamed grounds of this ſecond part: Chriſts Satiſfaction, the Fathers acceptation, are thoſe pillers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rength to a promiſe. Without which it would not auaile to go to a promiſe. Weigh ſeriouſly that noted text, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters of God in his Name offer and ſeale vp in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:177956:135"/> the Word and Sacraments that word, <hi>Be reconciled to God.</hi> What ſayth the ſoule to this? I dare not, God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. True, ſayth <hi>Paul, but anger is not in him.</hi> Why? Becauſe He hath made (and accepted) him that knew no ſinne, to be ſinne, that we might be the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in him: he that ſayd, <hi>In him hee is well pleaſed.</hi> Shall a poore ſoule be then as <hi>Noahs</hi> doue vpon the waters? <hi>Why ſay ye to my ſoule, Fly to the Mountaynes, Pſal.</hi> 11.1. if God be his ſtrong hold? If thou be vnder the condition of the promiſe, hee is no leſſe in his promiſe. Take a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. A man lyes in priſon for debt of a hundred pound: A friend comes to him, and bids him come out: he anſwers, I cannot, I lye heere for the debt: but beeing vrged, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that its not for nothing he is ſo preſſed by his friend, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e is ſome Surety hath payed his debt: and then there appeares a ſtrength vnto him, and laying hold on it, he comes out. Read that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>God hath ſet him forth to be a propitiation: that he might be iuſt in iuſtifying him who is of the faith of Ieſus.</hi> What ſaith the poore ſinner to this! O! but it is iuſt with GOD to puniſh ſinne whereſoeuer. Nay hauing made and accepted him the propitiation for a broken ſoule, it is euen iuſt to pardon him.</p>
                  <p>It was mercy to grant ſuch propitiation: but hauing ſo done, it is alſo iuſtice to pardon: euen as it is not iuſt to take one debt twice. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> pleades, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mee according to thy Righteouſnes:</hi> Chriſt hauing turned iuſt wrath into iuſt mercy. To conclude this, note yet a ſecond ſtrength in the promiſe: for the poore ſoule ſtill cauils. But this is to a beleeuer, I beleeue not.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, but the promiſe (by the power of the Spirit of our Aduocate) is able to doe that which it requireth: its not a killing letter as the Law, <hi>Do this and liue:</hi> but a quickening one, <hi>Beleeue and liue:</hi> it giues that it commands: the ſoule being vnder a promiſe, is vnder the Authority of him that bids her
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:177956:135"/> be reconciled. It is as with <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Waſh and be cleane:</hi> So he <hi>waſhed, and lo, his fleſh came as a childes.

This Name of Ieſus is much more in the promiſe of Reconciliation. Marke then: If the ſtrength of a promiſe be ſuch, ſay not, It is nothing, but take hold of it.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>What is the third bottome in a promiſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The faithfulnes and vndeceauable vnchangeablenes of it: this is a ſtrong bottome. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſpeech, and worthy all acceptance, Chriſt came, &amp;c.</hi> Read that ſweet place, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 55.3. <hi>The ſure mercies of Dauid,</hi> and the opening of it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 17.18. <hi>Surely bleſſing, I will bleſſe thee. Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew to the heires of his promiſe the immutability of his Counſell, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, (Couenant and oath, in which it was impoſſible for GOD to lye, wee might haue ſtrong conſolation. Why?</hi> Becauſe they are as two Cities of Refuge to a poore diſtreſſed fearfull ſoule (in the purſuit of Satan and conſcience to thoſe auengers) lay hold vpon.</p>
                  <p>Marke then, if the LORD deſcend ſo low to a poore ſinner, as to anſwer all doubts, by adding an Oath and a ſeale of his Sacrament, and a pledge of his Minſters faythfulnes, to aſſure the ſimplicity of his meaning<hi rend="sup">g</hi> then doubtleſſe, it muſt bee his honour to performe it, and hee that beleeues it not, muſt needes make him a lyer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.33. <hi>as hee that beleeues, ſets his ſeale to the</hi> Word that it is true. <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.19.

                  <p>Firſt, to marke it. Men giue no heed to Gods promiſes:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:177956:136"/> they lye hid in the Word, and are made no otherwiſe of then as other common paſſages. It is long before an hearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one of forty, till ſome croſſe driue them in as with an hammer: and then perhaps he remembers ſome one. A fearefull ſinne: read <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.8. <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſlighted the promiſe of GOD: the Prophet tels him, Is it not enough for yee to ſlight a Prophet, but God in a Prophet, not marking what he promiſes? Lo, I will therefore make a promiſe to my Church, and it ſhall bee marked, <hi>A <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin ſhall conceaue a Sonne,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>The eye of the ſoule muſt guide the heart in beleeuing. Set a ſtarre vpon the margin of a ſpeciall promiſe. Buy that booke that culs out promiſes of note in this kinde.

                  <p>I ſpeake to you of my owne Congregation, not without cauſe: leſt the precious promiſes ye haue heard, leake out, and this of Reconciliation in Chriſt, and the offer of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, Muſing of a promiſe: chewing vpon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> end of it as the cleane beaſt: hauing obſerued ſome of the choyce texts of Gods offer or promiſe annexed, dwell vpon it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh! wee boaſt that the Miniſter of God knowes leaſt of our minde. But if we deale ſo with Gods promiſes, we are like to fare worſe.

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond worke of the ſoule?</hi>

                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:177956:137"/>

                  <p>Due weighing, will cauſe the ſoule to ſee the whole heart and meaning of God in a promiſe, and to bee vnder the authority and euidence thereof. Elſe no beleeuing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1 fayth is called <hi>an euidence</hi> and demonſtration: as light at midday conuinces the eye of it ſelfe. So heere: the ſoule muſt ſee God nakedly in his promiſe; <hi>as in a mirror,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt. Ver. As the virgin is conuinced, that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the man aboue all other, layde out for her.

                  <p>This grace is the worke of the Spirit, making the ſoule to begin to thinke, Surely I am the partie whom GOD meanes: for I haue the condition wrought, and I ſee hee is plaine, and hath no ſubtilty, but is as he ſeemes: hence a ſecret inſinuation of heart arizes, I may bee the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Surely thou haſt done thus, becauſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:177956:138"/> thou meaneſt to pardon and ſaue me. I am (Lord) vnable to gainſay, thou haſt perſwaded me to beleeue.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third worke?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the cleauing of the ſoule to the Promiſe, againſt all her feares, doubts, cauils. For marke, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of cleere truth, the ſcales of darknes fall from her eyes. When <hi>Naaman</hi> had weighed the Prophets promiſe of clenſing, his cauils vaniſhed: no more ſpeech of <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Pharfar.</hi> So Thomas being conuinced by Chriſts hands and ſides. The ſoule is ſet betweene vanity and mercy, <hi>Iona</hi> 2.8. if mercy preuaile, then <hi>lying vanityes</hi> ceaſe. Then the ſoule lookes off from her former doubts, and beholdes the Temple out of the belly of the Whale: It then begins to ſet cloſe to the promiſe: As if a man that grafts a ſien in a ſtocke, ſhould fynd ſome clay ſtone to get betweene the one and the other, to keepe the ſap away, and make it warp from the ſtock: and pulling it out, lets the ſien come cloſe home to it. Hence it is, that a conuinced heart comes forth and ſayth, I cut off my carnall reaſon, I ſee no ſauor in it, I cut of my bold preſumption, I renounce my ſlauiſh feare, I abhorre my baſe mixtures of ſelfe and duties, vertues and preparatiues of my owne: I abandon all my former proppes of nature, art, experience, Religion which kept me from mercy; &amp; I cut al knots in ſunder which I cannot vnlooſe, and let all my tackling fall into the Sea, and commit my ſoule to thy promiſe, through rocks, waues and ſhelues, <hi>that if</hi> I <hi>periſh,</hi> I <hi>may periſh:</hi> onely I will for euer cling to thy promiſe, do with me as thou wilt: if I be deceaued, <hi>thou haſt deceaued me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the ſoule beeing conuinced, claſpes to GOD, and affiances it ſelfe to him, as the Iuy to the Oke, ſo that breake the one, and breake the other.</p>
                  <p>As the wife forſakes all, and cleaues to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>And this affiance cauſeth that ſweet conſent and naked obedience to the Word, according to the Word and the extent thereof: whereof read <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.19, <hi>If ye conſent
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:177956:138"/> and obey, ye ſhall eate of the good things, &amp;c.</hi> Conſent looking at a promiſe, and clozing with it as the ſeale with the waxe, and it with the ſeale, concurring therewith and beeing carryed in the ſtreame of it, againſt the motion of her owne rebelling heart, as beeing ouercome, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp her weapons: As <hi>Rebecca</hi> conuinced that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was from God, being called to ſpeake, anſwered, <hi>I will go to</hi> Iſhac.</p>
                  <p>And ſo followes obedience, which hath a reſpect to a command of God, nakedly conſidered in the promiſe of God: As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſimply looked at the charge of killing <hi>Iſac,</hi> in the meere power of God:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.17, 18, 19.</note> and ſo to the promiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Iſac,</hi> not beholding <hi>Saras</hi> wombe. See theſe two examples <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. of the <hi>Centurion I haue fiſhed all night, yet at thy Word, Lord, I will let downe.</hi> And, Say <hi>the word, Lord, and I beleeue.</hi>

                     </note> So the poore ſoule ſayth, LORD, in my ſelfe I ſee little why I ſhould thinke thy Word to concerne mee; but ſeeing thou wilt haue it ſo, I come in, <hi>and kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> ſubmit to beleeue, and put my ſelfe vnder the authority of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the last act of the ſoule about a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The laſt differs not from the former, ſaue in degree, and it is the cleauing to a promiſe, when there is ſtrong vnlikelyhood preſented to the ſoule: eyther from the Lords leauing it to her ſelfe, or in temptation, or in deepe ſence of vnworthineſſe, feare, &amp;c. Then ſhee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to cling to the promiſe by pleading it ſecretly: as wee ſee in that rare example of the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who was content to be put off by ſilence, denyall, yea taunts: and although ſhee was called a <hi>Dogge,</hi> yet ſhe held cloſe to the Word, that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of Dauid:</hi> A true Dog, and happy in this, that ſhee would not bee beaten off.</p>

But if ye will be wiſe, as yee vſe the Lord at firſt, ſo vſe him after: and hauing ſinned, let mercy firſt breake your hearts, and remember that Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Hob.</hi> 13.8. <hi>is yesterday and to day, and the fame</hi> in the order of his grace for euer. Otherwiſe the ſodering with the Lord ſhall cauſe ye much ſorrow: and yet you muſt come backe this way when all is done.</p>

                  <p>The firſt, among other lets, let theſe be auoyded: firſt, take heed of reſting in deuout complaints of the want of fayth.

Good complaynts made in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſuch as can eaſe vs, from the depth of a broken heart, is a great friend to faith: but counterfeict complaynts are the greateſt lets thereof.

See <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, It is as if a man a drowning ſhould hold his gold ſo faſt, that hee cannot take hold of a pole to ſaue his life: or as if ones hand coud not receiue a pearle, being full of nut-ſhels.

                  <p>Get an heart to trade with the Lord according to his way.

The argument ſtands in a compariſon betweene their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in their former ignorance, and that which the grace of God in Chriſt had taught them ſince, that is, that conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ye walked in before your calling, was very ſutable to the eſtate ye lived in: for, as then yee were vaine, blinde, darkned, hardned in heart, and paſt feeling in conſcience; ſo your courſe was prophane, eſtranged from the life of God, and given over to all laſciviouſneſſe and uncleanneſſe, even with greedineſſe, as they who never had enough of their luſts.

That ye be renued ie the ſpirit of your mind; that is, the truth of Grace in Ieſus hath this impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in it, that euery one that is in him, be renued and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>Second</hi> thing in the deſcription is the diſtribution of this generall into his parts: where firſt note the order, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the Negatiue part, and then addes the affirmatiue: Then the ſubſtance, <hi>firſt, That ye put off concerning, &amp;c.</hi> There is the purging out of the old man: <hi>Secondly,</hi> that yee put on the new, the former in v. 22. the later in 24. The <hi>third</hi> is in the 25. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> verſe: and that conteines the effect of this renuing within, to wit, the change of the conuerſation without, that it be as free from open euils as the heart from ſecret: and that it be as full of outward fruits as it's of inward graces, and hee expreſſes two contraries of lying and ſpeaking truth as a taſte of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Open now the phraſes of the Apoſtle in order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A. In the generall implication we haue Firſt, the neceſſity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177956:144"/> of it vrged in verſ. 23. thus whereas perhaps yee Epeſians are of mind, that it's ſufficient for ye to haue beleeued in Ieſus to ſaluation, and as for other fruits ye need take no thought how your life be ordered: I tell ye no, the Lord lookes that yee be alſo renued; and ſay not, that it will come of it ſelfe: no, let it be your care: <hi>Be ye renued,</hi> looke yee to it, it's weighty, it will coſt much paines, for although it's Gods worke in you, yet you may ſhrewdly reſiſt it by an idle looſe heart: but do you yeelde vp your ſelues in all meekneſſe of ſpirit to this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating work of the Spirit; be you moulded to it and faſhioned, not to old luſtes, or this preſent world, but to the renuing of the holy ſpirit ye haue the Spirit of God in yee, but ſtirre vp that grace of it which ye haue receiued, let it not lye dead, but accommodate your ſelues in all ſelfe-denial to this work, that faith may breake out in renuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We haue the work it ſelfe, <hi>Renouation:</hi> that is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſame thnig wich he doth in the end of the 24: verſe repeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and calles it the creation of the Image of God in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holineſſe: if we put theſe together, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to this: Firſt, that a beleeuer in Chriſt muſt bee no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> patcht, peeced, and broken ſtuffe, halfe old and halfe new, but an whole caſt molten new peece or veſſell: all new, pulld down to the ground quite and cleane, &amp; built vp al new, ſticke and ſtone, ſo that no man can gueſſe what manner of frame the old was, no more than a Barne can bee ſeene when a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſet vp in the ſteed of it. This is to be a renued worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Patcht things muſt reteane the old frame of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity though halfe new; but a meere Renuing changes frame and all. Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> this renued worke is a new Creation. It's Gods worke, its after God, none but hee can create: for creation is a producing of ſomething out of nothing: God creates this new man out of nothing. The new creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of no power out of his owne matter, but is meerely made of nothing, out of Gods matter and ſtuffe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is borne of the Fleſh is Fleſh, that which is borne of the Spirit is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Ioh.</hi> 1.13. This <hi>creature is not of blood or the will of fleſh, nor of the will of man; but of God.</hi> Thirdly, It is created according to Gods Image: marke this, a beleeuer in Chriſt, muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177956:145"/> be begotten to God by reconciliation, but muſt haue alſo his Image ſtamped vpon him, and be like him; as hee <hi>hath borne the image of the old man, ſo he muſt alſo of the new:</hi> as hee beleeues for his owne ſaluation, ſo hee muſt bee conformed to Chriſt for the honor and glory of him that hath forgiuen him As the wax takes the print of the ſeale, ſo doth the beleeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the ſtampe of God. Fourthly, This image is no new outſide of face or members; a Chriſtian hath the ſame members and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhape, and ſoule he had before for ſubſtance: but hee hath new qualities and gifts put into him, as true light of truth into his mind, true warmth of holines to God, righteouſneſſe to man, and pureneſſe to himſelfe put into him, euen Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in his diuine nature and properties. This is, the third.</p>
               <p>The laſt is, the Subiect wherein theſe are: That is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the mind. It is not denyed by <hi>Paul,</hi> but the body and the ſoule, and all the powers thereof are ſanctified and renued alſo as, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.18. but by this phraſe he imports, That the true ſeate of renouation is the inner man, or the <hi>ſpirit of the minde;</hi> that is, the beſt and chiefe part of the ſoule, the beſt part of the mind that which is the eye and guide of the ſoule, and the beſt of the will, that to the bent and purpoſe of the heart this: Spirit is as the Prince in his Priuy Chamber: if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, all obey; if the Spirit once bee renued, all the inferiors bow. This is the ſence of the generall implication.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Proceede to the order, and to the parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The order is, that firſt the Apoſtle vrges the negatiue <hi>of putting off.</hi> To ſhew that the Spirit of God neuer planteth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe till he haue purged out vncleanneſſe for who commits ſweet liquor into a foule veſſell? and what communion is there betweene corruption and pureneſſe? Secondly, hee addes, <hi>And put on, &amp;c:</hi> noting that the Lord accepts not of a naked abſence of euill, except there bee alſo the preſence of gracious properties.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What meanes he by the putting off the old man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>By putting off,</hi> laying aſide, purging, caſting out, he means forſaking, hating, renouncing and bidding farewell to luſtes. Not much differing from the former part of Sanctification: ſtanding in mortifying and crucifying of ſinne. <hi>By the old
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177956:145"/> man,</hi> he meanes old <hi>Adams</hi> corrupt properties, as blindneſſe, vanity (which heere is named inſteed of all the reſt) profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnrighteoſneſſe, &amp;c. Theſe he would not haue put off as we doe our apparrell ouer night to bee put on againe in the morning, but as our old rotten ragges wee caſt vpon the dunghill.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>And what meanes he by putting on the new?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The ſame which elſe where <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. vlt. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he calles<note place="margin">Reade that verſe.</note>

By the new man, he meanes the Lord Ieſus in his nature and qualities, of all grace and goodneſſe as before I named. So that this is a putting on of a better apparrell then cloth of gold and therefore admitting a better putting on, that is neuer to be put off againe?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the third part of the Text?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The fruit of both: For theſe are within, this dreſſe &amp; attire is ſpirituall: but the Lord will have his new Creature not onely all glorious within, but alſo without: All outward clouts and rags caſt off; he names lying, as one that is as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and common a worke of the fleſh as any, but meanes all: and he will have the outward attire of vertue alſo to be put upon the conuerſation, hee names truth (which as it is a <hi>Girdle</hi> to gird all other garments cloſe to us, ſo its one outward badge of goodneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">See Epheſ. 6.</note>) but by this grace of the tongue he meanes all other; of the body, ſences, life and converſation.

                  <p>Q. <hi>How many things are to be conſidered for the better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this maine point?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is indeede the maine of this whole part; and the things are eſpecially theſe foure; firſt, the Author of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or new Creature, the holy Ghoſt: ſecondly, the inward inſtrument of this author, and that is Faith: thirdly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177956:146"/> The ſubiect in which this regeneration is wrought, The whole man. Fourthly, the parts; theſe will prooue the chiefe: For as for the other which are taken for granted, wee neede not to dwell much vpon them, to wit, the ſeede whereof wee are begotten, which is the Lord Ieſus: the immediate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vſed to beget, the <hi>word of God:</hi> the ſeale by which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit aſſures &amp; conveis this regeneration, Babtiſme. Onely let vs take a Scripture for each: for the firſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Of him are we who is made, &amp;c.</hi> that is of Chriſt, Chriſt in his holy nature, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, and ſufferings and reſurrection, is the matter of our ſanctification.

                  <p>Q. <hi>Well then, let the former foure heads be a little opened: yet before thoſe, anſwer one obiection that troubles me: you ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that a beleeuer and a new creature are two things?

                  </p>
                  <p>A. Briefely I anſwer, that it's true, beleefe of the promiſe is Gods creation likewiſe. <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.18. But this prooues not that this article is needleſſe. For (as ſhall appeare in the ſecond of theſe points) regeneration is either a begetting vs to God, and making vs his, or elſe a begetting God in vs, and theſe two differ, as life diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs from the exerciſe of it. To vſe a ſimilitude, the childe truly quickned in the wombe hath the life of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, becauſe he hath the ſoule put into him: yet he is not ſaid to be borne as ſoone as he liveth; for hee muſt be perfected in the wombe, and brought forth, and ſo is a childe of the world; hee lived before the life of the wombe, but now he lives another life, in the light, feedeth, ſleepeth, cryeth, ſuckes the breaſts: So is it here; Faith giueth the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and life to the ſoule, at the firſt quickning; but the birth is not obtained fully, till it be brought forth as a new
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177956:147"/> Creature by Renovation: then it is declared to haue the true life of God, when his image of holineſſe declares it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Well, the Similitude may ſerue: let vs now come to the three heades and firſt what is the Author of this creation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The holy Ghoſt. As almoſt all the Scripture prooueth: Two places may ſerue: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, purged, &amp; ſanctified hy the ſpirit of our God.</hi> So <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5.6. <hi>He ſaued vs by waſhing of Regeneration and the renuing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>

                        </gap> 2.12.</note> And the reaſon is plaine. For euen as it was in the vnion of Chriſt our head, with our fleſh, the holy Ghoſt moſt miraculouſly did concurre with the matter of conception, and did vnite it to God, ſo that one perſon was made of two natures, and by this meanes the Deity infuſed into the humanity, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pureneſſe of God, and the quallities of light and holineſſe: ſo, this beeing for vs, lo, the ſame ſpirit takes the ſame matter of the Lord Ieſus his nature and properties, and vnites the one and infuſes the other into the ſoules of his people by the worke of the Goſpell. Not that wee made Chriſt (as ſome dreame) but vnited wholly to his perſon, and thence partake the influences of his graces, wiſedome and righteouſneſſe, &amp;c both in the habite of renouation, and in all the holy properties of humbleneſſe, patience, loue, feare, zeale, &amp;c. As 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3. moſt ſweetly ſaith, <hi>His diuine power miniſtring all things fit for life and godlineſſe, and making vs partakers of the diuine nature and gifts of the Spirit.</hi> And looke how it was in the old Law, that the next kinſman to the deceaſed was both to redeem his loſt inheritance (if embezeled) and then to raiſe vp ſeed to him,<note place="margin">Ruth. 4.5.</note> as vnto the firſt borne: euen ſo in the Goſpel, the Spirit of God doth not onely recouer vnto vs our loſt title and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Gods fauour by forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes: but alſo raiſe vp an holy ſeed vnto God, by begetting in vs his Image againe: ſo that not onely hee becomes our righteouſneſſe of iuſtificarion, but ſanctification alſo.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it's cleere by this, that the Spirit of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres with the offer of Chriſt vnto the ſoule, according as it lyes, and neuer ſeperates the things which God puts together Now (as I noted in Part 2. Artic. 4. the Lord offers his Chriſt wholly and at once: not onely adoption and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177956:147"/> to bring vs into fauour, but alſo ſanctification, to make vt the workemanſhip of God. Yea, and in truth, the Spirit lookes at this chiefly. For although in this life faith to iuſtifie a ſinner is the maine gift becauſe it giues vs the right of grace and heauen, and holdes it for vs: yet that which faith armes at is the renuing of the Image of God in vs. Onely bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſe we loſt it by ſin, therefore faith in the firſt place brings and knits vs to God in pardon: but the perfection of it, is that our loſt image in <hi>Adam</hi> might be reſtored. Now therefore the Spirit doth come and vnite them both together in the ſoule at once, becauſe Chriſt is not, nor cannot be deuided, either wee haue him not all, or elſe we enioy him wholly and at once as he is offered in the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. I would faine know what workes the Spirit doth for the ſoule in this new creation of nature, and infuſion of qualitiess?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. He doth two things. Firſt, perſwadeth. Secondly, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, he draweth the ſoule to be willing to take all Chriſt at he is offered, and to reiect no part of him: and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureth the poore ſoule in her application of the offer and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace. Hee preſenteth to the ſoules view the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God, to keepe backe nothing of his Chriſt: but hee will haue him wholly eaten as a paſſeouer, no bone broken, no part left. Though perhaps the ſoule ſee not the extent of Chriſt at one view yet the Spirit attends the offer of God in the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ceazeth the ſoule with that gift which God giueth. As if a man being to giue his ſeruant a bone, doth not onely reach him a ring (which the ſeruant thinkes enough) but a ring with a rich pearle of price ſet in it: The pearle is aboue the hope of the receiuer, yet becauſe it's not aboue the Giuers loue, both are taken at once. So heere the Spirit ſhewes the ſoule what God beteemes, wholy: tels it there is nothing too much, ſhee ſhall haue vſe of all for one vſe or other, and therefore let none be refuſed. And this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> doth by the tennor of Gods charter and couenant in the Word; See that noted place; <hi>Who is made of the Father</hi> all the 4: <hi>Wiſedome, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, the Lord offers not onely righteouſneſſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but ſanctification for image. Take all therefore.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:177956:148"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Spirit ſealeth theſe to the ſoule. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. The Lord Ieſus ſhall <hi>baptize with the holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi> What is that? the very diuine gifts of Chriſt, which as fire do purge and clenſe our droſſe,<note place="margin">Col. 2.12.</note> and bring forth our mettall as pure and cleane. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.5. he tels vs <hi>we put on Chriſt</hi> in baptiſme, and that not onely to couer our nakedneſſe, but to warme vs, with holineſſe. We are not only partakers of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to forgiue vs: but of his death to mortifie vs, and of his life to quicken vs, in both to giue vs his image. And by baptiſme we are ſayd to be ingrafted into the ſimilitude of his death and reſurrection. This baptiſme of the Spirit ſeales vp the ſubſtance of the couenant to al purpoſes, as a ſeale to a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting confirmes the writing in all points. Now marke the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the couenant: not onely to pardon <hi>our ſinnes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our ſinnes no more:</hi> but to <hi>waſh vs with pure water, to write his Law in our hearts and inward partes to cauſe vs to walke in his wayes, and to put his feare into our ſoules, that we neuer depart from him any more.</hi> And from this ſpirit of Renuing, proceedes the infuſion of all diuine graces, iſſuing from his holy nature, as loue, compaſſion, meekneſſe, feare, confidence, doing and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Chriſt and betokening our conformity.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>I reſt in your anſwer touching the firſt of theſe three now proceed to the ſecond what is the inward inſtrument on the ſoules part to apprehend this Creation?</hi>

                  <p>Q <hi>But here it a great ſcruple how faith ſhould be the apprehender of both theſe at once,</hi> viz, <hi>forgiueneſſe of ſinne and renuing of the ſoule.

                  </p>
                  <p>A. I grant the point needeth due conſideration: yet as the Lord ſhall guide me, I will endeauour to anſwer it. And ſeeing the truth hereof is as cleere in the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ure as any one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the manner thereof wil the better be found out. To this end, note that faith being the inſtrument of the ſpirit, in both the acts of regeneration (I meane reconciling and renuing) doth of neceſſity attend the worke of the ſpirit in both. If then it be true which I ſayd, that the ſpirit reades a lecture of the Couenant to the Soule, according to the whole purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; then needes muſt faith do likewiſe, euen follow the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſpirit in applying them equally to her ſelfe; for faith is <hi>as the eye of the handmaid to the Miſtres;</hi> that is, do that which the ſpirit ſuggeſteth, and takes all which the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers her: euen the Lord Ieſus at once, and wholly. If the ſpirit ſay: take Chriſt both for pardon and ſanctification: lo, it takes him for both together; of the former there is no doubt. Let vs ſee for the latter. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. the Apoſtle prayes <hi>that the eyes of the mindes being enlightned</hi> (by faith) <hi>they might ver.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>ſee the exceeding powerfull and mighty worke of the Lord Ieſus in them that beleeue,</hi> that is, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hee can doe by the power of his death and reſurrection. So in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. end: he praies <hi>that they might haue Chriſt dwel in their harts by faith that ſo they might comprehend his length and depth:</hi> that is, take him as hee is to the ſoule, and haue the knowledge of him that paſſeth all knowledge, beeing filled with his fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>So that faith takes the Lord Ieſus in his fulneſſe, that ſhee might bee compleate in him, both for mercy and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So if we looke <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. vlt. <hi>As thou O Father art in mee, and I in thee: ſo thy loue may be in them, and I in them.</hi> Marke, Chriſt is not onely offred to the elect to be for them in pardon, but to be in them to dwell, to rule, to comand, to exerciſe power ouercorruption and for gouernment, to bee as a ſoule in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177956:149"/> body to act, guide and beare ſway in them, as the branches in the vine, out of which they wither: ſo that the promiſe offers Chriſt both for vnion of reconciliation, and alſo Communion and influence of grace. In both which ſhe takes him, for he is not diuided, <hi>a pearle is little worth being broken.</hi> Now then looke how the hand of the Prophet was vpon the Kings in ſhoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing ſo is the hand of the Spirit vpon the ſoule in beleeuing; and as the hand of the writer vpon the learner to frame it his way, ſo is the ſpirit vpon faiths hand. And as the wax takes all the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e print of the ſeale, ſo doth faith of the promiſe by the hand of the ſpirit. So that although its certaine that nothing is more vnlike than the things themſelues which faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, (in the manner of apllication) the one taking a grace onely imputed, and reſting onely in the act of God, caſting forgiueneſſe vpon the ſoule without any addition of inherent goodneſſe to it: the other, taking Chriſt as infuſed and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the powers of the ſoule: yet this puts no difference vpon the apprehenſion of faith: ſeeing with one hand and one act, both the Lord offers them, the Spirit ioynes them, the ſoule beleeues them. The ſpirit is that which doth order theſe two benefits, and ſettles them vpon the ſoule and in the ſoule: but faith with one hand and act doth receiue them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeuerall vſe and ſeruice, as the ſpirit pleaſes to apply them. It pleaſes the law to conveigh a Copy-hold by Court roll, and a free hold by other conveyance of writing, ſeale, deliuery and poſſeſſion: but the ſame hand takes the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and receaues the liuery and ſeaſon. So heere.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What doth faith in the application of this Gift of Reneuation or the new creature?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Two things: It workes the heart to be renued by an argumentation. See 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>For the loue of Chriſt conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, becauſe wee thus iudge, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, faith iudges the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aright, and paſſes a ſound verduict vpon it. If Chriſt haue ſo loued vs, how ſhould our ſoules earne toward him in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his bleſſed nature, faith is in this as in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, a deepe Logician, ſhee argues for God ſtrongly, ſhee brings euidence vnanſwerable for him: that as a ſhe carries about her the marke of a diuine cauſe, beeing the moſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177956:149"/> Divine worke of God, that ever hee did ſince the Creation, above all the gifts of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ayming at a better end: ſo ſhe carryes alſo ſtrong reaſon to move the ſoule to bee like to her workeman, and to reſemble his holy nature. The word <hi>(conſtreine: vs)</hi> ſignifies ſuch an hemming in, as of the beaſt in a Pound or Pinfold; that is, put into it, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The very ſavour and inſtinct of faith tends to holineſſe: ſhe ſerves to abandon nature, &amp; to ſet vp holines in the ſoule. As ſhe ſettles an imputed holineſſe to iuſtifie, from Chriſt; ſo ſhe cannot reſt, till ſhe her ſelfe partake it within. Such things as are alway lying among ſweets, cannot chuſe but reſemble and ſauour thereof: Faith comes from the divine breath of God, and is his gift; therefore cannot degenerate: but as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers flow from the ſea, and runne thither, ſo doth faith come from God, and returnes to him, ſhee ſins not till ſhee haue ſo pleaded for God, that ſhe haue drawne the heart to ſauor him in his holineſſe. And ſecondly, by infuſion. She is the Tunnel of the ſpirit, to convey the renuing of the holy Ghoſt into the ſoule. As the hand of the workman is that liuely cauſe of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> buyes a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous root of a rare flower (that grows in few gardens) &amp; giues it into the hand of the Gardner to ſet it in his garden. The gardiner thruſts the root an pitches it into the earth, giues it good mouldes, waters and keepes it charily. Euen ſo heere, The ſpirit of ſanctification is the purchaſer of this roote, but it plants and pitches it into the ſoile of the Soule by this hand of faith: and there it nouriſhes and cheriſhes till the root bring forth a flower ſutable to the nature of it. Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafts this pretious ſigne of the righteous holy nature, life, death and reſurrection into the ſoule, or rather (if yee will) the twig of the ſoule into the ſtocke or ſoile of the Lord Ieſus his holineſſe: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Such corne as wee ſow wee reape: if we ſet a carnation wee looke the flowers ſhall bee ſutable, if wee ſet an apple into a ſtocke wee looke for no crab; euen ſo, this plant of loue brings forth loue againe, and this roote of holineſſe, a fruit like it ſelf. That of <hi>Eph,</hi> 3.16. is for this point. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Faith is the entertainer of Chriſt in this his holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſe. So then as in the former point faith ſauours the truth in Ieſus, and tels the ſoule that Ieſus comes into thither to ſanctifie in for God as well as to ſaue it from hell: ſo heere it's the inſtrument of the ſpirit of Ieſus to apply and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant this roote of his in the ſoule: it applyes the Couenant as well in the promiſe of renewing it, as of forgiuing it; and it embraces and claſpes hold vpon the Lord her righteouſneſſe: and till ſhee haue done both, ſhee dares not ſay, Thou art my God, and I am thy child: yea, as the holy Ghoſt is that fire wherewith the new Creature is baptized, (when it comes to beleeue the Coeunant) ſo faith is that hand which applies the ſoule to this fire, to be purged thereby, and that inſtrument of the Spirit, whereby he refines the ſonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word, as <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeakes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third thing to be noted?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſubiect wherein this new Creature is planted: and that is the whole man. Read for this, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23.

Wee meane not a renewing of the Subſtance of either, as if a Renued ſoule ſhould be another ſoule or body, but the ſame in point of the qualities, or ſeruice of both. Its corruption which is purged out, and its grace is planted in. The ſcurffe and poyſon of each faculty is caſt out, mortified, and conſumed; its a new property is put in: ignorance, rebellion, pride, impatience is taken away, and knowledge, ſubiection, humility, and long-ſuffering put in: And this ſubiect is the whole man. Each part and power of body and ſoule is renued, and if not all, none at all. The Spirit of Renouation is an entire workeman, and purgeth all, graceth all; the minde with light, the heart with heat, the conſcience with ſound reflection and witneſſe, the will with free choyce and conſent to holineſſe, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with ſerviceableneſſe to the ſoule in all her deſignes.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>Speake a little of the particulars: What is renuing of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the powers thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A,</hi> Vnderſtanding not only is corrupted in the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but alſo in the prerogatiue of it. It was ſet vp as a rule and directiue of the inferior ſoule, will, affections; but it hath loſt this bieth-right now, and is become the vaſſall of the will, and concupiſcence: therefore the renuing of it is, partly a purging of it from the corruption and penalties thereof; and chiefly a reſtitution of it to her integrity of light and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Light in the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Will being depraued in point of her loyalty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the minde, and now having caſt off the yoake, and become rebellious; the renuing of it is, both the purging of it from the ſinne, and penalties of it, and a reſtoring of it to her integrity of ſubiection, to the verduit of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; chuſing, refuſing, or ſuſpending accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the renuing of Conſcience?</hi> See, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sinne hath depraved the Conſcience in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, ſo that it cannot preſent any goodneſſe of being or action to the ſoule with delight and contentment; but is waxen defiled, and either accuſing, or erroneous and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: therefore the renuing of it is, both a cleanſing of it from her contagion, and a reſtoring of her to her integrity of faithfull accuſing for evill, and excuſing for good: See <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. by contraries.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the renuing of the body?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what part is eſpecially the Subiect of Renuing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Howſoeuer the holy Ghoſt, doth renue all, yet the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and cheefe ſubiect of her reſidence is the Spirit of man. There are (as I ſaid) ſundry faculties in the ſoule, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177956:151"/> is the moſt inward, and immediate actiuity of it, and it ſtands in the directiue gift of the vnderſtanding, by which it fore-ſees and deuiſes for the whole man: as alſo in the free choiſe, bent, ſauor and delight of the heart. So then, the frame, ſtreame and bent of the ſoule is the ſpirit of it,<note place="margin">See Eph. 4.23. Rom. 12.2. Rom. 7. vlt.</note> &amp; that wherein this renuing or new creature ſtands. As it is in the old man, ſo in the new: it is not a few thoughts or affections which make a man bad: but the very frame and bent of all the thoughts and affections whereupon as vpon wheeles the whole man is carried. And as a ſon hauing the liuely picture of his father to behold, would not ſet it vp in a ſtable or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, but in his beſt roome. So the ſpirit of Chriſt ſets vp the Image of God not in the eyes, or eares, or tongue which haue no power to worke vpon the ſoule, but in the Priuie Chamber of the ſpiuit where the King lodgeth.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And what is the fourth thing in this Renewing,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The parts of it negatiue, and affirmatiue: the former a deſtroying of the old frame, the latter a ſetting vp of the new; which are the exerciſes of the inward graces of renouation. Both of them iſſuing from the Croſſe and Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcention of Chriſt: And thence it is that in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place, <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes mortification to the death; viuificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the reſurrection of Chriſt. Not that they are to be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, for both ſerue for each, and each for both: but as both cannot ſtand together, but one in the deſtruction of the other: ſo, he would teach vs, that the death and riſing of Chriſt are no fables, nor ſtories, but things of exceeding merit. Both for ſatisfaction and for efficacie or power.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord Ieſus ſuffered his precious ſoule to part with his body, hee gaue that death a power to diuide ſin and the life thereof: and when by his God-head hee reſumed his body, he gaue it alſo a power to put life of grace into the ſoule The death and life of Chriſt are a myſtery of godlineſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. end, tels vs; when Chriſt <hi>layd downe his life</hi> for the expiation of ſinne, withall hee entred into a moſt deadly fiend with ſinne whch would haue robbed him of his life for euer: and when hee tooke his life againe by his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, hee alſo conveyed an efficacy of a quickning ſpirit to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177956:151"/> raiſe vp all beleeuers to a renued life of holineſſe, and by his ſpirit, beſtowes both vpon them. So that he who can bring ſinne to the Croſſe and graue of Chriſt by faith, ſhall kill the life of it: and he that can apply his ſoule to the Lord Ieſus ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, ſhall finde it no empty, but an effectuall meane to quicken him to holineſſe. And theſe both, all true beleeuers doe: as they haue borne the image of the firſt, ſo muſt they doe of the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> the firſt was a liuing ſoule, but the ſecond a quickning ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Now at length proceede to the vſe: and becauſe the opening of the Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Such as boaſt they are no changelings, are the ſame men? I ſay they are vnbeleeuers, vpon whom (as yet the wrath of God abides and beſides ſuch as ſhall be damned. Dogs who ſhall bee without. See 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.8. therefore ſmall cauſe haue yee to boaſt. If all that be happy by beleeuing muſt be holy by renuing, how vnhappy ones are all vnholy ones? Therefore let it be terror to al ſuch as carry the old man writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their foreheads with great letters, ſo that all that runne may reade it, they proclaime the ſinne of Sodom in open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanneſſe, or in ſecret vnreformedneſſe: they haue beene drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, breakers of Sabboths, Athieſts in their families, and ſo they will be ſtill: Oh wofull wretch! wilt thou bee as thou haſt beene? thou haſt beene an old wretch, an old fornicator, wrathfull wretch, ſubtill, contentious, worldly made the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pella couer of thy rotten heart: wilt thou bee ſo ſtill? Then I know thou art curſed, for thou wert curſed, and thou wilt be as thou haſt beene.

But know this, that if God haue concealed the vp to an hard heart, it is one ſtep further off from God, then before, it will

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> terror to all hypocrites who ſtill maske ouer the old man with a new couer of Chriſt but put not off the olde.

Lately I knew a man who vpon the change of his eſtate by marriage, was ſo penſiue, that no man could heale his mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly: ſo it is with theſe, to heare of ſuch a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and change as ſhould turne all inſide outward, and ridde them of their old <hi>Adam</hi> all at once, they are ſullen and ſicke vpon it, it is as the going of a Cammell through the eye of a needle. Ieſus they know, and the Doctrine of Ieſus, but not as the truth is in Ieſus: they will take no notice of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct as to be new ones, becauſe beleeuing ones. But oh yee wretches, euen this truth of Ieſus which your hollow hearts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177956:152"/> cannot brooke, ſhall iudge ye and ſentence ye; ſuch new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuch Ieſus; your Ieſus is an Idoll, becauſe hee is no truth in Ieſus, no new creature in Ieſus to put off the old man, and put on the new. Laſtly, all prophane ones who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in very good caſe, if they can carry their luſts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued corruptions cloſely, and bleare the eye of the world, thinking they haue forſaken them. <hi>Sleidan</hi> reports of a Duke in <hi>Germany,</hi> who liued in an vncleane eourſe with one of his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is the new creature of the prophane ſort; ſtrongly to conceale the old. Like whereto is this, to thinke our luſts are mortified becauſe by ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent cauſe, feare, penalty, or inward terrors, they are reſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it's vſe of inſtruction to all new creatures to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> that the Lord will accept them to be ſo, and take them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter al their refuſe ſtuffe and ſeruice to old luſts to be new men; who would thinke it that the Lord ſhould chuſe ſuch defiled Temples of Idols, luſts, and lewdneſſe, to dwell in? who would thinke he would admit of thoſe naſtie ſties of vncleane thoughts, thoſe cages of pride vncleaneſſe, and ſelfe-loue, thoſe powers, &amp; members of body &amp; ſoule that haue been ſo defiled, to bee weapens of righteouſneſſe? Oh what encouragement is it to old creatures to become new? The Lord will melt and alter the property of your old Idols, and he will prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe euen of ſuch mettall, veſſels of price, for euery good work. He will admit the captiue woman, when ſhee is pared, waſht and ſhauen, to be a wife for an Iſraelite: hee wil admit <hi>Mary Magdalen Luk.</hi> 6. her eyes, teares, hayre, lips and oyntments, euen ſo neere as his owne ſacred body, and become one with her that was an harlot, and abuſed all theſe to abomination. Oh! how iuſtly might hee haue for euer left vs to our ſelues,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177956:153"/> and ſworne that no ſacrifice ſhould blot out our ſinne, nor would hee euer take the ſeruice of a perſecutor to bee a preacher? Oh thoſe very powers of wit and thoſe affections of loue and ioy which we haue ſo abuſed, wee ſhould wonder that God will purge the fretting leproſie out of them ſo far as to be honored by them? which yet we cannot deny but he hath, except we ſhould lye againſt the grace of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it ſhould admoniſh all to take heed how they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <label type="milestone">

Let vs know they are new creatures and the workmanſhip of God: him that defaceth Gods image, will God deſtroy. Beware, touch not the annoynted of God, doe not his image any wrong. If a King will leaue him to the puniſhment of a Traytor, who ſhall race out and deface his image vpon a peece of ſiluer: what ſhall hee doe to them that deface the liuely image of his holineſſe ſtamped vpon his new Creature? doe not deſcant here and ſay, ye doe not deface them as ſuch but in other reſpects? well but in as much as hee hath honoured them, yee ſhall pay for it, that yee haue not counted them precious and delighted in them: that honour ye doe not to them as well as that diſgrace ye offer them, is not done to him, is offered to him: and if you dare venter to hurt them with a diſtinction, he wil puniſh you without diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>If the Lord will haue others beware how they deface <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>4</label> Gods creatures, how much more ſhould his new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beware of defiling themſelues? Oh! if God haue made ye ſo, beware ye caſt not dung in his face, and pollute not his image? The vileſt wretch that liues when hee playes his parts, yet if he were the ſonne of an holy father, he will draw the curtaine ouer his fathers picture, as aſhamed of himſelfe? And ſhall not we tremble to diſguize our ſelues with any dreg of earthlineſſe, enuie, pride, and vanity, loue of our ſelues knowing whoſe Creatures we are? Take but the creatures of ſome proud ambitious ones! will they doe any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtfull to their makers? are they not in all points like them? How then dare we to tempt him after whoſe image wee are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177956:153"/> created? Oh! what a check ſhould it be, that any leauen in ſo much as a mouſe-hole (to allude to that Iewiſh curioſity) ſhould bee found in vs? Remember that charge of <hi>Paul,</hi> Purge out the old leauen therefore:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> and let vs ſerue the Lord in the ſincerity of a new Creature: old things are paſſed away, all things become new: new <hi>Adam,</hi> new couenant, new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; new Miniſtry, new Creation: new Lord, new Law, and all new. Shall they who are thus renewed, ſuffer that vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued part to get head and to darken and defile the new? that euen in them old baſe dregs ſhould bee obſerued to deface the Image of God? But more of this in the latter Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Proceed to the vſe of the ſecond branch?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. If faith be the inſtrument of this Creation, wee heere doe confute the conceite of them that imagine faith to bee a branch of Sanctification. Sanctification is ſo farre from bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the genus or totum of faith, that it differs from it the wide skie. Faith is a grace that addes no inherency to the ſoule, but onely ſerues to receiue a forraigne imputed righteouſneſſe of another: ſanctification receiues an infuzed righteouſneſſe in to the ſoule, faith receiues a righteouſneſſe of perfection to ſtand in the ſight of God: ſanctification, a righteouſneſſe in part and imperfect. Can then an inherent holineſſe bee the cauſe of an imputed? or can an imperfect holineſſe bee the cauſe or <hi>genus</hi> of a perfect? But I muſt not dwell; and I ſee this error is lately at large confuted. Onely this, faith and a new Creature being parts of Regeneration and of the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of a conuerted one: ſo long as they bee diuiding members they are rather things of a contrarie nature, then effects and cauſes of each other. See what I ſaid of their difference in the beginning of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee learne heere what courſe Gods people muſt <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>5</label> take to repaire the ruines of their holineſſe, when it is decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them by their falles, Satans preuention or the like. Run to their faith, fetch fire from the hearth of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his ſpirit: wee are preſerued by that of which we conſiſt if the Lord Ieſus bee our principle of Regeneration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177956:154"/> by faith, hee by faith muſt be our ſuſtentation: goe to the Promiſe in thy fals, take hold of the ſtrength of Chriſt in them, and compaſſe not thy ſelfe with thy owne ſparkles, thinking to recover thy ſelfe by thy owne heate; but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy ſelfe, go to a promiſe, and there behold &amp; apply Chriſt thy righteouſneſſe to pardon thy fals, to accept thee in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to repaire thy ſtrength, and then h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>A:</hi> Very ſpeciall: And it ſhould firſt teach us a diſcerning uſe, betweene all hypocrites and truely renued ones. The one may ſet up the Image of Chriſt in ſome of the powers of his ſoule; as in his underſtanding, wit, memory, in his tongue, eares, ſences, and outward members: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Creature ſets him up in his Spirit. This of all other things ſearches a falſe heart; whatſoever part of him ſeemes to have ſome image of God, ſure it is, it is not in his ſpirit. In ſpite of him, his thoughts, purpoſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are voide of him. The ſtreame, the frame, the bent of his ſoule warps from him and goes another way. The moſt ſubtile hypocrite can but come to this, to delude himſelfe by the ſtrength of knowledge, and ſome dammings of the ſtreame of his corruption: but as for the turning of it by a ſtrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, to a contrary motion, that can hee not attaine to: there is no diſſembling of a new Creature. Once a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in 30. yeeres made an iron frame of a man to ſpeake; but as one ſaid of him, Oh fine ſcull without braines! ſo here may be ſaid, Oh faire out-ſide without a principle of life and ſpirit! Let us conſider this; although an hypocrite may grow to this, to delude himſelfe, and make himſelfe not to ſee his defiled principle, yet he can never purge it out, while he is ſo. For the Image of God is ſet up onely in ſome out-roome, and when his luſt comes in place, there is no routing for this; this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177956:154"/> muſt yeeld to his baſe eaſe, pride, luſt, which are ſet up in his inner man, and beare ſway. And ſecondly, the hypocrites i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God is onely a counterfeit of it: its no free principle acting him from within; ſo long as ſome torrents and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pangs are up in his paſſions, ſo long as he is under ſome ſtreame of powerfull preaching, or deepe feares, or ſudden humours of affection, he ſeemes ſome-body: but when theſe are paſt, he is like himſelfe, as dead as ever. I may compare him to <hi>Davids</hi> old body, in which there was no heate left; they ſought out <hi>Abiſhag</hi> to keep heate on him, but more then he had from her, he had not, and therefore he dyed inſtantly notwithſtanding her: So is it here. So long as the five is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the water it hold it; but no ſooner out, but all is empty: when the Word is gone, and violent cauſes, he wanzeth, and diſcovers thoſe corrupt evils of uncleanneſſe and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which the word ſuppreſſed. But with the new Creature its otherwiſe: he is borne of God, and ſinnes not with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: when outward props faile, loe all failes not, he mournes for the want of old helpes, but in this want he abounds with the comfort of the inner man, &amp; the principle of grace which is immortall, and whoſe being is of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, its uſe of conſolation to a beleever: the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>7</label> him by his beſt part, his bent and ſtreame, and not by his defects. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Not I, but ſinne in me. I ſerve God in my ſpirit, ver. ult.</hi> As a man cals a dunghill precious, for a pearle in it: and as a man would cal wine mixt with water, wine; and corne full of weedes, corne, becauſe of the better part. So here; the ſpirit and bent of the heart denominates a Chriſtian with God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Its uſe of examination for all that would be ſure <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>8</label> to know the new Creature to be formed in them. Try it by the roome wherein ye place it: the beſt things require the beſt place. The image of God in Chriſt, drawne by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will endure no roome but the moſt inward ſpirit of the ſoule. If the enemy beſiege a King, hee muſt breake thorough many doores and locks ere he come at him; becauſe hee is in his privy chamber. Try thy ſelfe then by two or three marks. If the new Creature be ſet up in thy ſpirit, then wil the ſtream
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177956:155"/> of thy ſoule goe with him and to him as the riuers to the ſea. Thy plotting, thy diuiſing, fore-caſting and whole wiſedome ſhall ſerue for him, how his honour, ſeruice, Sabbaths and himſelfe may be ſet vp where thou haſt to doe. The Spirit of a Drunkard or Mizer will not ſo plod about the pots or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as thine for God. Thy tongue, eares and all will bee for him. Thou maiſt ſtep out of the way, but ſtill thy bent will be to ſerue him and ſpeake for him in thy ſpirit. If memory or great words faile, thy ſpirit will bee for him as that poore man was for Chriſt <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. read the alluſion. Againe the ſauour of thy heart will be in and for him. The bent of the ſoule commonly goes where it delights, and to that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to it, try thy ſelfe by this. What hath got thy heart? Where is thy treaſure? If Chriſt in a new creature bee it, lo, the very inſtinct and ioy of thy heart will bee to him, other things ſhall be vnſauory, thou ſhalt ſtinke in the noſtrils of an old man, and he in thine. And ſecondly, try thy ſelfe by this. The ſpirit of the ſoule is the chiefe part of it, there is the whole ſtreame. If the new creature be ſet vp there, God is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued withall the might, the male, not the female, all the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſtrength:<note place="margin">Pro 23.26.</note> no coſt is too great: The whole coſt of all thy powers, members, gifts, authority, credit, wealth, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall runne in the ſtreame of holineſſe. No vnbeteeming one can be a new Creature for hee is free borne. The minde we ſay is the man. If that be for God, all the inferiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will ſide with him as <hi>Iezabels</hi> Eunuches with <hi>Iehu:</hi> as the leſſer wheeles of the perpetuall motion did the firſt moouing Maſter wheele.

As appeares by that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. let the courſe be without couetouſneſſe: by which hee doth not onely condemne open oppreſſion, or vſury, but the wheele of the thoughts, affections, and endeauours of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</p>

                  <p>A. Some concerne the perſons who muſt lead this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: ſome the conuerſation it ſelfe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A. That this conuerſation bindes all ſorts equally to the good behauiour without preſcription, or exception, and that in mens ſeuerall eſtates, conditions, relations. Eſtates, as in proſperity or aduerſity: <hi>Iob</hi> 1. Thou ſpeakeſt like a fooliſh woman! Shall wee ſerue God, for good and not for euill? Conditions, as in each trade or calling, each common reſpect, of ſexe, age; each condition of degree, inferiour, ſuperior; each ſexe, whereto adde all other regards, as time, place, publike or priuate occaſions and accidents be falling, as either alone, or with others, at home, abroad, and the like. Laſtly, relations, as Maſters, ſeruants, parents, children, husbands, wiues, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Subiects, our ſelues, or ſtrangers within our roofes, and ſo of the like. A maine and great enclozure, at once cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the infinite obiections and cauills ariſing from ſuch perſonall reſpects. Some would exempt themſelues by their greatneſſe, as our common ſpeech imports; they are very good folkes for ſo noble or ſo rich, or in ſuch place. Why? thy place puts vpon thee ſo much the greater ſeruice. Others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their meanneſſe, as if the Lord ouerſaw them, as motes in the Sun: ſo many poore ſeruants in great houſes thinke that the Sabboth and religion is for their Maſters, as for them they ſhall bee paſſed by. So ſome ignorant people alledge this new learning is for Schollers: and ſo young ones excuſe themſelues by their greeneneſſe, old ones by their feebleneſſe, &amp;c. But as this nett of obedience is ſtrong enough for Lyons: ſo the maſhes of it are ſmall enough for flyes.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the order of good conuerſation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. That the chiefe and maine ſeruices of God bee preferred before the meaner in time, and in priuiledge. In time thus, that firſt religious courſe be attended, then worldly. If a man ſhould paint the body of a man and ſet his heeles vpward, how diſguiſed were it? So for vs to go and moile our ſelues
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177956:156"/> all day long, and then at night with a dead heart, and a drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie ſpirit to fall to prayer; oh how wofull? This is out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a ſetting of cart before the horſe: ſince that ſhould haue been firſt done, and the belly attended after. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32. firſt ſeeke the kingdome. Secondly, order of honour. That is, when two ſeruices met which cannot both be done at once, that the leſſer giue place to the greater. (Except neceſſity or mercy do hinder) which is no breach of duty, but an omiſſion onely for the time, and a returne vnto it in ſeaſon: And in this point a good conſcience is the beſt interpreter.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is proportion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. When there is a ſutableneſſe betweene duty and duty. In the members of the body, when ſome one for the part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes the proportion of that part, or of the other parts, there is a diſguizement: As when the head is bigger then an head ſhould be, or bigger then other parts which ſhould exceed it: for example, when men in their zeale exceed the rules of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and are too hot and eager; or when they are exceeding zealous for religion and the Sabboth, but extreame cold and remiſſe in point of iuſtice and righteouſneſſe, and keeping touch with men. Secondly, when there is no ſutableneſſe of harmony: as in the body, if one member bee comely, another deformed; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he face comely, the back crooked, it's a blemiſh. So here: when there is good behauiour between couples abroad, but great oddes at home: when men haue very good gifts to ſpeake, but very bad to practiſe, none better in compaſſion to the poor, none worſe in matters of conſcience toward God in their calling, marriage, or vſe of libertie. <hi>Abner</hi> was a very good Captaine to <hi>Saul:</hi> but an adulterer: <hi>Ioab</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but a murtherer. So the Prouerbe runneth, hee is no mans foe ſaue his owne: but loue muſt begin at home and iſſue to others.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Beauty of conuerſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. As in the body beauty and amiableneſſe ariſeth from the good temper and fit coherence of parts: ſo in conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beauty is that grace, which ariſeth from the giuing to each qutie, her due reſpect; not onely doing it, but looking how, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. the Apoſtle tels vs, let him that giueth, do it in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, hee that ruleth with diligence, he that ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177956:157"/> with cheerefulneſſe;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.1.</note> wiſedome makes the face to ſhine. It is not the bare doing, but the due tempering of it with the right quallity, that ſweetens it. And where this due manner is generally obſerued, it makes the whole conuerſation, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſauory: yea, ſets a luſtre vpon it. Theſe three may ſerue for a taſte of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Now come to the ſubſtance of Conuerſation: To what heads may they be referred?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. To theſe three, eſpecially: Either thoſe graces which do qualifie a good conuerſation. Or thoſe ſubiect things wherein conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſiſts; or the obiect which conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looks at.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are theſe graces of conuerſation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Some are generall qualifications of grace, concerning euery part of conuerſation one and another: others, are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all gifts of the ſpirit, ſeuerally belonging thereto: as the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life requires. Q. <hi>What are the generall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. To giue a taſt of all by ſome of the chiefe; they are either graces of quality or quantity: the former, ſeruing to the due manner, the latter, the due meaſure of holy conuerſation. And of the former ſort are theſe (I ſpeak of ſom of the chief: 1. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, 2. Simplicity, 3. Sincerity, 4. Integrity, 5. Faithfulnes, of I doe which a word for opening of their natures, remembring that not here write treatiſes, but onely a view of things (at largehandled in the miniſtry.) Q. <hi>What is Wiſedome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. A grace of the ſoule, whereby it draweth the ſanctified knowledge of the mind, to the particular vſe of her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as occaſion is offered. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. And it is a determing of generals to ſpecialls, both of actions, and circumſtances, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſtian rules, of which ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Finally, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatſoeuer is pure, good, of good report, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo its a grace teaching him that hath it to keep a decorum in religions and outward conuerſation: as knowing what his perſon &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wil beare or refuſe. Laſtly, how to carry himſelfe in the vſe of things indifferent without exceſſe or defect: &amp; how to vſe Chriſtian policy with ſimplicity &amp; purenes of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Simplicity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is a grace of a renued ſoule, looking at truths in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nature, apprehending and iudging of them without all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177956:157"/> mixture or corruption of fleſhly conceit and wiſdome: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly deſirous to be informed of them as they are, and to loue, embrace and enſue them accordingly, neither looking at the right hand or left: I feare that as Satan tempted <hi>Eue,</hi> ſo he tempt and lead you from the ſimplicity of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Sincerity or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is a grace of the Soule looking at the actions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, in reſpect of their right and true ends: and therefore as it oppozeth al hypocriſie, which is to do good with a ſquint look and mixture of our owne ends of credit, gaine, eaſe or content: ſo it doth good with a pure ayme at Gods glory, the honeſt diſcharge of duty, and the good of others: ſo as a man may haue good conſcience in all things. See 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. and <hi>Act.</hi> 26.1, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. he abhorred to be an hireling. This is called perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> of parts not degrees.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is faithfulneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> It properly reſpects the due manner of conuerſation, that it be holy and approouing what is accepted, howbeit properly it hath a reſpect to oppoſition: For as we ſay of a good and faithfull ſeruant, wee dare truſt him with vntold gold, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although we ſee them not: ſo this grace is ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, as puts God in ſecurity not to reuolt from him or warp notwithſtanding baytes to allure, or terrors to diſcourage, or dangers to deferre, either by threats, error of the wicked, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed times, or provocations from our own falſe hearts, <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.13. and <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.8. Thou haſt kept my word and not denyed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſeruant.</hi> It's alſo taken for ſincerity. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is integrity? and what grace of the ſoule is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An equall and whole vprightneſſe of it towards all the Commandements of God, without partiality or taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. When I haue reſpect vnto thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. It is contrary to that halting of ſpirit with God, and patchery of a falſe heart, whereby it affords God a maymed ſacrifice: in ſome duties forward that come on the right ſide, but ſuch as finde not fauor in our eyes, reiecting them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the Graces of quantity or meaſure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They may be referred to two: Proſperity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:177956:158"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Proſperity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A grace of the ſoule compounded of many; in a word, the welfare of a ſoule in reſpect of degrees and meaſures of grace. And it hath three parts: firſt, Rootedneſſe: ſecondly, Fruitfulneſſe: thirdly, Growth. Rootedneſſe of the ſoule, is a grace contrary to ſtaggering and ſlightneſſe; whereby it is both grounded wel in knowledge for direction of life, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in grace for full purpoſe and reſolution of obedience. See that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult. unmoveable.</hi> So elſewhere, the word of ſtabliſhing and ſetledneſſe in the grace of the Goſpell is uſed. Alſo 11.23. That with full purpoſe of heart they would cleave to the Lord. Secondly, Fruitfulneſſe is a grace iſſuing from rootedneſſe; whereby the ſoule is abundant in the worke of God, and full of the fruits of weldoing. The contrary is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe and emptineſſe, when the ſoule ſcants the Lord in his due, as if he were an hard Maſter. The effect of it is to auoid unprofitableneſſe in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Read for this grace 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi> The third is, the fruit of both, <hi>to wit,</hi> Groth and encreaſe: For as wee ſee it to be in trees, when they are once well faſtned in the earth &amp; rooted, we looke they ſhould beare fruit; and then that in ſo bearing, they waxe and grow, in height and bredth and fruite, ſo is it here. Groth is a grace of the ſoule, by which it encreaſes by due ſteps &amp; degrees, to that fulneſſe of the meaſure of Chriſt, according to the proportion of the part, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.15: <hi>Pet. ult. Luk.</hi> 8.8. And it commonly is the effect of the meanes of grace, bleſſed to the beleeving ſoule, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Now then of theſe three ſtands Proſperity: which is the ſpirituall gladneſſe and laughter of the thriving ſoule, 3 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. Thy ſoule proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; that is, apparently is fat and well liking in goodneſſe (as thoſe three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. and as we ſay, the corne and hops laugh upon the ground and poles that beare them.) And it is a grace of the ſoule rooted, fruitfull and growing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it beareth marke in the ſight of all,<note place="margin">Act. 15.23.</note> that it goes well with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to Godward, and is cheerefull, full of health, vigor, and contentment, ſaying thus, What I am, I would be, and wiſh no better.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Continuance?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> A grace of meaſure in the ſoule, whereby it gives not in, nor is faint or weary in weldoing: and its contrary to ſtaggering, ſloth and eaſe. It hath two branches: the firſt is, firmeneſſe and reſolution in the truth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4:12. The other reſpects the courſe or wheele of converſation: and it is either a going on and on from duty to duty with ſtrength and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.57. and long-breathedneſſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 84, 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Run the race with patience ſet before thee, taking alwayes in good part thicke and thin, and not fainting in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and troubles.) Or elſe it is ſmall Perſeverance, the fruit of the former: for by a continuing in well-doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. and accounting each day a peece of our journey home, at length we attaine the end of our hope, and the iſſue of our faith and combat. This grace hath the honour of all the reſt; not becauſe the reſt are inferiour to it, but becauſe it hath the lot above all the reſt, to ſtand next to the doore of ſalvation, and to let in the ſoule thither: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13, 14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. And thus much of the Graces qualifying good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation generally.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the particulars that immediately helpe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> All the ſanctifying graces of the ſpirit of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the peculiar uſe they have in converſation; as ſome are more proper for one uſe, ſome for another, and all for ſome or other. Thus faith is a grace for the juſt to live by to God in the world; hope is a grace to beare up in ſtreights; patience, in an affliction; thankfulneſſe, in bleſſings; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in lawfull liberties; innocency and righteouſneſſe in the common life of men; love generally helpes all: &amp; in a word, each grace doth more or leſſe ſerue for the enabling of the ſoule to a well a bearing of it ſelfe towards God, man, or ſelfe. Of theſe I ſpeake no more; onely I would adde one thing, That graces of the ſpirit ſerve not onely to take up the reſidence within, and no more, but mightily to ſtrengthen the ſoule to all ſpirituall or externall converſation: ſee that <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11.

Note then; As in a Wheele there be three parts, the nave, the ſpokes, and the round: ſo here; the nave is compared to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of regeneration, or the new creature (of which in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle 1.) the ſpokes are theſe graces I have named, iſſuing from the nave, and faſtned to the round: for as theſe ſtaves doe unite the ſtrength of the nave to the round, and carry the ſtrength thereof to each part of the wheele, which elſe would breake and ſplit in ſunder: ſo theſe graces of the ſpirit of Chriſt are the ſtaffe of our life, and the very ſupport of our converſation, and wheele of our courſe. As for example; Take away knowledg from the uſe of our liberties; faith, from the Sacraments or Word; love, from viſiting the ſicke; mercy, from almes, where ſhall theſe parts of converſation become?</p>
                  <p>And thus much of this firſt part of the ſubſtance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in graces.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the conſideration of the Subject who is to lead this converſation; that is, the regenerate perſon. Now looke what the ſeverall inſtruments are by which a Chriſtian doth and muſt ordinarily converſe, thoſe are the ſubject in which it ſtands, and therefore had neede to be accordingly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the Thoughts, and what rules are there for the frame of their converſation?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">2 King. 5.20.</note> Not to ſpeake of <hi>Gehazi</hi> his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den following <hi>Naaman, Felix</hi> his hope of a bribe from <hi>Paul,</hi> the diſciples exceſſe of ſorrow vpon a word ſpeaking by Chriſt, that fooliſh pity of <hi>Ahab</hi> vpon the men of <hi>Benhadads</hi> errand, the extreame feare of the women vpon the Angels words, All theſe Cloudes of witneſſes, ſhew the vnbridlednes, of the paſſions: and therefore ſhould prepare vs with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to preuent them. Secondly, yet note, how affections are as ſoone vp in armes if the heart be well ſeaſoned and ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with grace. How ſoone was <hi>Peter</hi> mooued with holy feare vpon the draught of fiſhes? <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.8. How eaſily was the poore blind man rayzed vp in the depth of loue to the Lord Ieſus? how ſoone was ſorrow wrought in the hearts of three thouſand murtherers at once by <hi>Peters</hi> preaching? how preſently was compaſſion mooued in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> toward the cripple, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.4. how quickly was zeale ſtirred vp in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> againſt <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi? Numb.</hi> 25.11. and ſo may bee ſaid of the reſt. Thirdly, therefore, let vs nouriſh the fire of the holy Ghoſt kindled in vs in our firſt regeneration, and apply it daily to the ſhaming, purging out, and conſuming of theſe luſts. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. Bring them (as the heifer in ſacrifice) to the hornes of the altar, and binde them thereto, that they breake not looſe. And call vpon the Lord for his ſpirit that the arrowes of the Almighty may be in vs, and the power of Chriſts death might be as venom to giue theſe luſts the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow and bane, and to drinke vp the ſin of theſe affections in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177956:162"/> vs! Let it ſeriouſly ſmite our hearts, and let our affections take reuenge vpon vs, forth Corruption of our affections. Let vs not excuſe our ſelues for our nature, for that defends a leſſer ſinne by a greater: for what can be more wofull, then when ſinne by cuſtome hath hardned vs to a nature? Remember wee how hideous effects theſe wild beaſtes haue wrought in our liues? I ſay, our wealth, our inordinate loue, our mirth, our ſorrow, feare, and indignation? How might <hi>Dauid</hi> with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row haue recorded his diſtemper againſt innocent. <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.29. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his great ioy and iollity in the comming of thoſe Embaſſadors, <hi>Eſay</hi> 39.2. and the truth is the greateſt woe and repentance which euer betided vs in our life may well be fathered vpon our paſſions? Some bringing themſelues by them to needles ſuits of Law, purſuits of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, loſſe of their eſtates, fines, impriſonments, a brand of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach among men as not to be liued with: and if not ſo, yet a continuall bondage of ſpirit, and vnfitneſſe to any good, either to calling, prayer, bearing of our croſſes, or family and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age duties, and all by our inordinate paſſions? Fourthly let vs apply the merit and looke at the example of the Lord Ieſus in all the whole conuerſation of his affections! how holy was his zeale againſt thoſe defilers of the Temple?<note place="margin">Mat. 21.12,</note> his loue to that young mans forwardneſſe?<note place="margin">Mat. 23.13</note> hatred of thoſe hipocrites the Scribes and Phariſees? ſorrow for our ſinnes in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den? cheerefulneſſe in conuerſe withall ſorts to winne theme weeping for <hi>Lazarus?</hi> pity to the poore widdowes dead only ſonne? <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.13. Oh! the ſauor of his example, and merit of his affections, who as hee abhorred all ſtupor of heart, ſo neuer faulted in the euennes, temper, meaſure, of them either in the defect or exceſſe, ſhould rauiſh vs, and excite vs (if true members) to purchaſe the like? we ſhould euen conceiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heate of ſpirit before theſe rods. Fifthly, when we haue got theſe good affections, learne wee to take a due marke of the right obiects of our affections and that will ſhame vs, when by looſing or miſtaking our right marke we doe faſten them baſely and indirectly. Our anger is to good to be ſet vpon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reuenge, it will ſerue to be imployed about Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. our loue is too good for baſe luſts, mony, and

If we would thus direct our affections, they would ſtart backe when other obiects lay clayme to them. Laſtly, let our maine direction be, to get our ſoules ſettled in peace, in the ſweete aſſurance of our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, and that we know the worſt that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, that no ſinne, ſorrow or en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo much for theſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What rules giue you for the third, of actions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Herein wee can giue no particuler rules: becauſe they are infinite: but bring the generall rules to particular and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident occaſions. Therefore, for the ordering of this conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let thoſe foure vſuall golden rules direct vs that wee (as neere as we can) look to firſt, our grounds; ſecondly, to the due manner: Thirdly, the true meaſure: fourthly, the right ends of our actions. Touching which the leſſe may ſerue becauſe they trench vpon ſome former rules.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Touching the firſt, what is it to be grounded?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To be ſure, we haue a word to ſhew for our warrant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in doing, or not doing, or ſuſpending: for although the action may proue bad in the form which is good in the nature of it, yet that which is bad in the ground and nature, cannot be poſſibly well done. For, without knowledge the heart is naught:<note place="margin">Pro. 19.2. 2 Pet. 1.19.</note> Now the word will paſſe cenſure vpon it either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by conſequent: and therefore we muſt attend to this light, eſpecially in darke places. And if wee cannot informe our ſelues alone through ignorance we muſt make it a booke caſe, and aduiſe by all meanes with other, for truth lyes deepe ſometimes. This is a maine ground: and is exceedingly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed. I wil not here inſiſt vpon them as go againſt light, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177956:163"/> the godly abhorre it, while they are themſelues) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of them, many ſorts faile. 1. Some wil do many things vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cuſtome and taking your grounds for granted when yet they haue none. Theſe are to be informed, that they may know themſelues to do well as well as do that which is good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thank. 2. Others do many things in the twi-light, hit they miſſe they: not vpon aſſured ground not conſidering, that as well that which is done without faith is ſin, as that which is againſt it. 3. Many take vp grounds onely in their generality and faile in the particular determining of the generall, to their occaſion, and ſo ſometime exceed ſometime limit the word, whereas they ſhould go according to the word cloſely in the extent of it. Thus many limit the 2. commandement, to groſſe idolatry of Pagans &amp; ſecurely go on in your own idolatry &amp; wil-worſhip; as the Papiſts. Others take their own preiudice, deuotion, good meanings to be good grounds, as blind people. And laſtly, others corrupt the ground by falſe gloſſes; &amp; theſe ſundry waies. 1. By adulterating the word, both of rule and example in ſcripture, and making it ſound as they liſt. This is to crooke the rule and then work by it: thus thoſe Phariſees. 2. By corrupt error of mens traditions, as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued from the father, alledging <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei:</hi> but it is not a common cry can ground an action. 2. By Satans cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and dice-play, as he dealt with <hi>Eue: ye ſhall not dye. Gen.</hi> 3.4. Thirdly, the impoſture of our owne hearts, eaſily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it lawfull, which we eagerly deſire, and ſo bribing the iudgement to giue in a falſe verduict to deceiue vs: as the meſſenger that went for <hi>Micaia,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. and as a bribed iudge will force a good iury to bring in a falſe anſwer, that he may ſin by preuiledge. Laſtly, and eſpecially through the neighbour-hood that good hath with euill oft-times, who would not commend the pity of him that refuſed to ſmite the Prophet? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.36. or the fact of the good mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues that ſaued the women of Iſraell, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.19. and who would not (at firſt) diſcommend the Leuites for ſlaying their brethren? <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. But wee muſt doe no good, that euill may come of it; and where God diſcharges the conſcience from a Law, there is no tranſgreſſion;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177956:164"/> as in the borrowing and robbing the iewels of the Egiptians appeares. Therefore, let vs cleaue to our grounds: abhorre all doubtfull, generall, erroneous ones: take paines to diſcerne betweene the colors of good and euill, and beware we be not lead by the errour of wicked, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. end, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the right mannor of actions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So neceſſary is this rule, that it reaches to all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yea, the moſt indifferent in her nature, and ſuch as wee are not tyed to, but are arbitrary, yet when they are done, are to be done in a right manner, or elſe we ſinne. And this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing, requires two things: Firſt, that they be done in the eſtate of well pleaſing. Secondly, well pleaſingly: for the former, it is an aſſurance that the perſon pleaſes God <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. for the latter, it is a cleauing to the quality of performance that it be pure. To the pure al things are pure in their lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet euen pure things muſt be done purely alſo, as I noted before in the Beauty of Conuerſation: each action hauing in it a peculiar quality to commend it, as there I noted in diuers inſtances. And therefore next to knowledge, the eye of the ſoule muſt call for this true mannor, that withall cloſeneſſe, entireneſſe, humbleneſſe, faith, wiſedome, loue, cheerefulneſſe, reſolution, it may performe that which is good. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate nothing.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is the due meaſure of Actions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the Lord be ſerved with the beſt of us; within, by the beſt bent of our ſoules; without, by the beſt extent of our abilities; and that wee keepe no falſe meaſure within vs. Our courſe is to deale with God, as buyers and ſellers doe each with other; buy by one meaſure, and ſell by another. So we, when we trade with God, are content hee ſhould ſell to vs by the largeſt buſhell, heaped, thruſt, and running ouer; but we repay to him by a cut, ſcanty one. But as we doe, or would fare at Gods hand, ſo ſhould we meaſure out vnto him: and in all that we doe to him, or for him, call forth the beſt of our ſpirit, and bent of heart, all our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and might; and alſo enlarge our actions to the greateſt extent we can in number, and in degree; that our goodneſſe may be as diffuſiue and exemplary (as without hypocriſie)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177956:164"/> and within, within our compaſſe may be. But I haue ſpoken of theſe two before: of the one in the Subiect, of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of the other in the grace of Meaſure: Looke backe to them.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the true end of all good actions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is one of the maine of all the reſt. For as the end, and ſcope of a thing giues it the being: ſo a childe of God, is more properly obedient in his end, then in any: hee may faile through ignorance, or weake carriage, or meaſure, but in this is his glory; That the deſire of his ſoule is towards the Lord: and that he may approoue himſelfe to haue had an vpright ayme at the Lords ends: the glory of his name, good of his brethren, and peace of his own heart; whatſoeuer elſe he failes in, in preaching, in prayer, in mercy and compaſſion, in Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths, in example, yet that in this he is voyd of guile. See <hi>Pauls</hi> boaſting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. we haue had our Conuerſation in ſincerity, &amp;c. This was <hi>Abimeleck's</hi> praiſe (for the moral of it) that he had done it with a pure intent. It is that God lookes at <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. It was <hi>Dauids</hi> reioycing that he walked in the perfect way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2. and <hi>Aſa</hi> his prayſe, that in all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, he ſtill held vpright in heart.

As huckſters deale with their milke, honey, and wares, they mixe them with waxe, water and traſh, for the vantage, ſo doth our heart ſeldome any action but ſome dreg, and dead flye of our owne aymes and ends is ready to defile it Beware therefore, and let a true end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſteere all the actions of our life.

                  <p>Q. <hi>Proceed to the third branch of the ſubſtance of conuerſation, concerning the obiect thereof: what is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is two fold: either our Spirituall Conuerſation with God himſelfe: or our Conuerſation with man in our common life.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is our conuerſation with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Godly conuerſation (as <hi>Peter</hi> calles it) is that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which a renued ſoule hath with God: or in a word, it is the ſoules enioying of God (ſo farre as here may be) and it is either inward, or outward:</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is inward conuerſation? how manifold?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is twofold, either the life of faith, or the exerciſe of the Graces of the ſpirit within the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the life of faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſoules enioying of God, Chriſt our Sanctification, by all his promiſes concerning life and godlineſſe. And a faith at the firſt drawing neere to God, did cleaue to him in Chriſt by a promiſe for reconciliation (as in <hi>Article</hi> 6. of the ſecond part) ſo it proceedes, and improoues Chriſt her ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for all needes and vſes of this preſent life. For (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) if being enemies wee were reconciled to him by his death: much more by his reſurrection wee ſhall partake his life. And againe, If he haue not denyed vs his owne Son, how much more ſhall hee not with him, denie vs any thing. Now ſaith vnderſtanding whole Chriſt in ſanctification to be made hers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. doth draw (as a man would draw lines from a Center to the circumference on each ſide) ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler promiſes of vpholding the weake ſoule in each condition: that ſo ſhe might ſay in all, <hi>Now liue I, yet not I, but Chriſt in me; And the life I liue,</hi> I <hi>liue by faith in the Son of God,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>The iuſt man liues by faith:</hi> not (as ſome inuert it) <hi>The iuſt by faith ſhall liue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What promiſes doth faith liue by in Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To ſpeake of all were endleſſe: for a draughts ſake, I referre them to foure heads. Firſt, eſtates. Secondly, meanes Thirdly, duties. Fourthly, graces: which may ſerue for the reſt. The ſum is, Ieſus Chriſt is the life of the ſoule throughout and as before and without Chriſt, the ſoule liued a naturall, and common life, of ſelfe, world, pleaſures, vanities, ſo ſhee now liues the life of Chriſt in all thoſe foure. And ſhee is thus ſaid to put on Chriſt: that as a man in his apparell doth all the workes of this daylie life, ſo doth the ſoule all her workes in Chriſt: Chriſt in her, prayes, preaches, proſpers, ſuffers and in a word doth all her workes in her, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the life of faith in eſtates, and firſt in Proſperity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The cleauing of the ſoule to God in the promiſe of his Al-ſufficiency. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. end. Al things are yours, and ye Chriſts. Its the Lord Ieſus our head who being Lord of all, made himſelfe no body, that we might haue right to all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177956:165"/> promiſes. Faith then cleaues to this promiſe. Firſt, That if God hath made vs a feaſt in the mountaines, much more hee will in the valleyes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 25. And looke what bleſſing ſo euer he ſee good, it's mine, life, good daies, good marriage, children, family, health, ſucceſſe, recouery, credit, wealth, it's mine. A childe of God beleeues no temporall promiſe otherwiſe than a ſpirituall: both purchaſed by Chriſt alike, although if he ſee them vnfit, I am to beleeue a ſupply otherwiſe as good or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but elſe faith cleaues to a temporall in the full right to Chriſt without ifs or ands, as well as the other. And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but ſerues Gods prouidence for them with holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſetting the Lord aboue his owne labours, in the ſecret bleſſing of a promiſe: going to worke without indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without ſinne or ſorrow: beleeuing that whatſoeuer his portion be, more or leſſe, it's his, giuen him by his father, and therefore beſt, and any other ſhould be worſe: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, accounting the commoneſt bleſſing to be no common loue to him, but vouchſafed in kindneſſe to his ſeruant; and therefore not ſnared thereby and nailed to the earth, but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp rather as by wings to the giuer, to ſerue the Lord with a good and cheerefull heart for all his bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the life of faith in the eſtate of aduerſity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is the cleauing of the ſoule to God in the promiſe of his protection and redemption: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. The poore ſoule ſaith with <hi>David</hi> on his death-bed, The Lord liueth who hath deliuered my ſoule out of all aduerſity; ſword of <hi>Saul,</hi> purſuit, enemies in battell, and now will deliuer me in deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. And how? firſt, as it was with Chriſt, that no trouble, nor yet one houre ſooner befell him than God preordained: ſo ſhall a poore ſoule beleeue that no enemy ſhall hurt, or afflict in any kind, then, or vntil the Lord ſee meet; but as he, ſo thou ſhalt paſſe through all: ſo alſo, 2. If any doe aſſault thee, ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, poverty, ſuits, priſon, malitious enemies, thou ſhalt ſay with Chriſt, This is their houre, they are come in ſeaſon, they are meet: read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. they are no accidents, they are the allottings of my Father for ſpeciall good. 3. When they doe lye vpon thee, yet the Lord ſhall bee thy light in darkeneſſe, and ſhall bee thy defence, and couer thy head in the day of

So that thou ſhalt ſay, Perhaps the Lord ſhall doe me good for this croſſe this day, make me better than if I had not had it: It is good for mee that I was afflicted. And after a tolerable paſſage (read <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.6, 7.) he ſhall deliuer me out of all, one way or other: ſo that the ſpirit of glory, and the conqueſt of Chriſt reſts vpon me, and by his promiſe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. <hi>vlt.</hi> I haue ouercome the world, I ſhall take good courage and ſay <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8. I <hi>ſhall riſe when</hi> I <hi>am fallen:</hi> and afterward I ſhal with the Lord Ieſus be out of the gunſhot of all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: yea, as the eſtate of a beleeuer is through his whole life, ſo ſhall it be comfortableſt at death, and the laſt day ſhall be his beſt; a reſt from all labours.</p>

                  <p>A. Its the cleauing of the ſoule to God by a promiſe for ſtrength to giue vs the grace to doe what hee commandeth: of which alſo ſeeing I treat, in Article 3. vſe 4 there looke.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the life of faith in Graces?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It's the ſoules cleauing to God in the promiſe, and in the grace of the Lord Ieſus, for a ſupply of grace conuenient for it ſelfe, both for number and meaſure. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.17. from his fountaine we receiue grace for grace, like for like, ſo many for ſo many. In the ſtrength of this promiſe, a poore barren ſoule comes to the Lord, and hearing what treaſure is in Chriſt, and for whom, comes with confidence and pleades for it ſelfe; Oh Lord as empty a wretch as I am of mercy, of compaſſion, of righteouſneſſe, of loue, of patience, thou haſt put all into the nature of Chriſt <hi>Emanuel:</hi> though I am peſtred with a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh froward, proud, worldly ſpirit, yet thou haſt ſayd, <hi>where ſinn hath abounded, grace abounded much more:</hi> thou delighteſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177956:166"/> to honour thy Sonnes grace in purging ſuch ſinfull ones from their curſed qualities: thou wilt haue thy grace pointed at. Oh! who would haue euer haue looked to ſee ſuch a proud wretch, humble, ſo worldly an one, heauenly minded? Nay; the Lord can vſe thoſe weapons of ſinne, to bee weapons of righteouſneſſe, choler to turne zeale for God, prodigality to turne bounty to the poore members of Chriſt. I ſee where the Lord creates the new creature, hee alſo creates the graces thereof: where he marryes, he giues the marriage Ring beſet with all Iewels of faithfulneſſe, humbleneſſe, and the like. Why then ſhould a poore member pine away for want, when the head is full? and full for his members? Oh! I ſee all things are mine in Chriſt, all meanes, duties, yea, and graces mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Didſt thou not ſay ſo Lord? and cauſedſt me to truſt thee for it? that out of thy Fountaine I ſhould haue for both number thoſe that are moſt wanting, and for meaſure, that which may ſtrengthen a feeble heart? Euen as <hi>Haman</hi> hearing, what ſhould be done to a fauorite, anſwered, he meanes me, whom elſe? ſo the poore ſoule heere: The Lord hath renued mee, and whom ſhould he beſtow Graces vpon to beautifie ſooner?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Goe forward to the ſecond branch of our Communion with God, wherein doth it conſiſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In the exerciſe of the graces of his ſpirit. For looke how Merchants and Chapmen haue the policy and traffike for wares and mony, ſo the godly haue their commerce with the Lord for grace. Read <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3.19. <hi>But our conuerſation is in heauen.</hi> And this ſtands in theſe three things: Firſt, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their graces: for the experience of the ſweete gaine and price of grace wich they haue oft gotten from God doth whet their deſire to couet more of them, and to bee better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Lord in them. As <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent till he had ſeene God in his glory. This is one effect of our Sauiours prayer, that they may be one with vs, and that thou wouldſt keepe them from euill and from the world: ſo the faithful trade with God for more faith, vnion, hope, loue, patience, and when they can get in with the Lord for any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe, they thinke themſelues in the ſuburbes of heauen. Secondly, In the reioycing in the groth and encreaſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177956:167"/> they haue had. No mizer doth ſo oft viſit his bagges, as theſe ioy in their treaſure. The leſſe they ſee of theſe iewels in the world, the more they prize them and fleſh their hearts with them: as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The God of peace fill yee with all ioy by beleeuing.</hi> And againe, we reioyce with ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious. Thirdly, and eſpecially their trading is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by that precious hope which is an earneſt-penny of their inheritance: and therefore they neuer think of it, but it glads their hearts. This is that heauen vpon earth, and the treaſure which their hearts are ſet vpon, which in a ſort makes them alſo to be heauenly minded: makes them vſe theſe things as if not; and deſpile the image of theſe vanities: yea makes their croſſes, ſlight in compariſon, while they looke not vpon things temporall, but eternall. And by this their trading, although they bee abſent from the Lord, yet are they in a ſort preſent, and lay hold of immortall life to make their condition below the more tolerable. And ſo much of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the outward converſe of the ſoule with God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that holy correſpondency which it holds with God in outward ſeruices.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are thoſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Some are ordinary, ſome are occaſionall. The ordinary are many: I will giue a taſte of a few: and they are, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and dayly walking with God in religious duties, for the increaſe of Communion. It is not the wheele of duties doing which can ſupport the ſoule; it muſt bee a due keeping of quarter with the Lord, and a ſurvey of her eſtate towards God, which muſt doe that. Of this ſort are theſe. Firſt, A ſatisfying of the ſoule with the Lords image at our awaking with a ſaluting of his promiſe for renewed pardon and grace: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>vlt.</hi> for Ieſus Chriſt is yeſterday and to day and the ſame for euer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. not changing. Secondly, a ſeeking of his face as oft in the day as may bee for renewed humiliation and for keeping the heart open dayly, for pardon of renewed ſinnes, grace to purge and ſeaſon the ſoule: thankes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed compaſſions: Thirdly, a reuiuing of couenant with him for cloſer purpoſe, and bent of heart towards him. <hi>Act.</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:177956:167"/> 11.23. Fourthly, a dayly recording of Gods peculiar admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations and prouidence to vs, in patience, bleſſings, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ſpeciall redreſſes of our decayes in ſoule and body, and what vſe we haue made of them. Fifthly, a finiſhing of each day ſo, as we viewing it ouer, may be humbled or comforted, and ſo lye downe in peace. Q. <hi>What is the occaſionall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſeruice of the time, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. by which wee reſt not onely in our ordinary ſeruing God: but reach our ſoules to the condition of the times we liue in accordingly carrying our ſelues, either in affliction of ſoule, or thankſgiuing as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion requires.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Conclude the Article with the latter branch: what is our conuerſation with men in common life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The ſame which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> 50. <hi>vlt.</hi> calles, the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of conuerſation aright. And it is a wiſe accommodation of a Chriſtian to the ſeuerall paſſages that befall vs vnauoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in this our common courſe of life. In the which although there be a world of euill committed; this being the element of worldlings, and the ſtage whereon the Deuill acteth his parts: yet euen in theſe common matters the Lord teacheth his people to carry themſelues, as men of another world.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall rules be giuen touching this part of conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it beeing ſo infinite?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By culling out ſome of the chiefe paſſages of the reſt and giuing a briefe view of their due ordering: wee ſhall the eaſilier gueſſe at the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Name ſome of them, ſhew of what nature they are, and what ordering they muſt haue?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Such as theſe, Marriage, Company, liberties, ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, earthly buſineſſe, calling, family gouernment, and the tongue, or common talke. Which although they bee out of the boundes of Gods worſhip, yet are ſo to be conuerſed in, as remembring the name of God may bee blaſphemed therein whout eſpeciall caution, euen as in the vſe of oathes and vowes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Seeing diuers treatiſes ar extant about them, and they haue been handled in the Miniſtry by ſundry occaſions, giue onely a briefe view of the ordering thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:177956:168"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Generally touching all, note this, that God abhorres all common prophane vſages of the world in theſe things: and will haue his people ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry about them the cognizance of new Creatures and holy ones, that they may not make religion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious by their corrupt behauiour and making vſe each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein for their owne ends: but that the graces of God may breake out and ſhine in the order of this part of conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to the glory of our profeſſion. Then particularly, there is required a ſtayed, ſetled ſpirit, not vaine, light frothy and inconſtant, ſo that each occaſion accidentally offering it ſelfe ſhould vnſettle vs, and put vs out of our courſe of life: as ſometimes ſudden ill newes driue vs into melancholy and frowardneſſe: ſucceſſe in our affaires carry vs into endleſſe lightneſſe, and iollity: ſhrewd turnes in family worke vs to diſguizement and impatience. Wee ſee how it is with ſome diſordered men, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for a weeke or fortnight together they will ply their callings, but if company draw them to the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, they will ſpend whole dayes and nights in a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe. Such baſeneſſe the Lord abhorres: and will haue all to ſet their ſoules in order to an holy ſoberneſſe and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, wiſely framed to entertaine the changeable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of life; which the well-ordered Spirit, neither in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe or defect, but as the obiect, requires.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And what ſpeciall directions are there? and firſt for the married condition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. That they loath to make it a common thing for the vſe each of other, and prophaning the Ordinance: but firſt, improuing it chiefly for God, and the mutuall good of their ſoules: Worſhipping God together, making him umpire of all their differences, powring out their hearts into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome by humiliation, prayer, and thankſ-giuing: Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matrimoniall loue as a ſacred knot; and to that end, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing each others graces for the ſtrengthening thereof. Cutting off all iarres in the beginning, and yet not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together for baſe ends, but for holy. Tendering the weakeneſſes of the weaker ſexe, concealing her defects, and yeelding ſubiection to the head for conſcience.</p>
                  <p>If theſe rules and the like were obſerued, how might the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177956:168"/> order of this one part ſet an order in all other parts of our courſe? whereas the diſorder of this wheele, cauſes all other to be diſtempered; children vnruly, ſeruants vngouerned, and all out of frame? And when once things are growne to extremity, then they wiſh they had never met; as indeed the truth is, miſerable is that marriage which the bond of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity holds together.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat rules are there for mens Calling?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A, The Calling being ſo great a wheele of Conuerſation, (for where we worſhip God one houre, we ply our Callings a great many,) had need to be well ordered: Firſt, Beware of picking quarrels with your Callings; change not Callings at your pleaſure, (though I deny not ſome caſes may fall out to compell a change,) but cling to thy Calling to keepe thee from noyſome luſts, eaſe, ſloth, and leud company; which nothing but a Calling will prevent: As that Martyr bleſſed God for honeſt wedlocke, ſo doe thou for an honeſt Calling: Secondly, Vſe it not for the baſe ends of gaine, money, and the like, (for Gentlemen haue as much need of Callings as poore men,) but to ſerue prouidence, to mortifie thy luſts, and prepare thee for the duties of worſhip; knowing that elſe thou wouldeſt vaniſh in religious duties, and be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thy ſelfe. Thirdly, Let an order bee ſet in thy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that it hinder not Religion in Family; neither let Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hinder thy calling; but both know and keepe their bounds. Fourthly, Neglect not thy Calling ſuddenly, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon needleſſe pleaſures, trauells, companies, and ſo leaue thy family in a diſtemper, without either prouiſion or gouernment: but in ſtead of theſe, abide diligently in the Calling, in which God hath ſet thee, without wearineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the rule of trading man with man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. That men ſeeke the good of a Common-wealth, not a priuate. The prouerbe is, <hi>Euery one for himſelfe:</hi> and in this age, ſelfe-loue hath corrupted mutuall commerce exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo that if men may gaine, they care not how, by what ſhifts, deceits, breaches of promiſes, running away with other mens goods, borrowing much, paying nothing, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with other mens ſtockes, and ſo prouing bankerupts,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177956:169"/> to rayſe ſome eſtate to themſelues by other mens detrement. And this is ſo generall a ſore, that no man knowes how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midy it, though few are free from the preſſure of it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the rule of conuerſation in common life?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The anſwer of that good woman to the Prophet, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.14. <hi>I liue among my people:</hi> meaning humbly, courteouſly, louing and beloued, vſe fully and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in our neighbour-hood wee are to practiſe innocency and harmeleſneſſe: as <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.29. meaning that a neighbor lookes for good meaſure, and to liue without annoyance. Alſo to maintaine euill offices of lending and borrowing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries; yea 'money to the poore, except they bee vnfaithfull (in which caſe they muſt be vrged to pledges) to ſhew mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all entercourſe of loue in meeting, moderate feaſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in the welfare of each other, to auoid ſtrangeneſſe, and encreaſe amity: auoiding ſtatelineſſe, lowring, diſcurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and wrongs to each other in common caſes of each other grounds, fences, cattell, and commodities. Againe, vſefulneſſe in counſelling, viſiting, releeuing ſuch as are in danger of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dripping enemies: eſpecially comforting them in ſpirituall complaints:</p>
                  <p n="2"> 2 In townes-matters, not ayming at over-ruling others, treading our inferiours under-feet, ſaving our owne purſes and over-burdening others, but carrying equall minds, and doing as we would be done to: not pragmaticall and buſie-bodies in matters not concerning us; but attending our own, and keeping our bounds. Not praters and janglers of needleſſe affaires, not curious, inquiſitive, cenſorious, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="3"> 3 In Arbitratorſhips, not ſtickling for parties, but for a peaceable agreement upon equall condition betweene them, and ſetling firme agreement upon the wiſeſt and ſafeſt termes, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What rules give ye for liberties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. There are many ſorts of liberties, as travellings from our owne homes, companionſhip with ſuch as pleaſe us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and paſtimes, feaſtings, and the like: all which are lawfull in their kinde; yet muſt be watched unto leſt too much
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177956:169"/> precious time, coſt, and heart bee ſpent vpon them: alwayes keeping from the vttermoſt of our liberty, and <hi>putting knife to our throat. Prou.</hi> 23.2. if wee bee giuen to our appetite: not powring out our ſpirit into them, and looſing our ſelues in them, but gathering vp either our ſoules to a more cheerefull returne to intermitted duties. Remembring that Satan will the rather ſeeke to circumuent vs in the vſe of lawfull, becauſe we dare not ruſh in vnlawfull liberties.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Draw to an end of the reſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Touching the family, we are to ſet it in order, not when we dye onely, but much more in our life. And for mixt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; firſt this I ſay, that they cannot chuſe but find much pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion both in matters of God, and their owne: God is the God of order, not confuſion: if therefore it can be, let mixtures of familes be auoyded, as preiudiciall to peace, thriſt, accord, and eſpecially goodneſſe: For if ſingle families are ſo hardly ordered, how ſhall mixt, whoſe heads or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers differ, and are loath each to ſtoope to one gouernement? Such ſhall be ſure <hi>to finde trouble in the fleſh:</hi> therefore where weighty cauſe requires it, let the beſt order be ſettled by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to auoyd confuſion, as it ſhall the better if all will ſtand to one bar, and be ruled.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the Gouernors of families (eſpecially greater) let them not thinke it enough to ſet vp a ſcroll vpon their ſcreen, touching the Lawes of their houſes, and ſo paſſe on: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let themſelues be the life of order themſelues, <hi>Prou,</hi> 27.23. and <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.27. <hi>looking ouer their flockes</hi> within doores, and not onely for prouiſion of body, but ſurvey of the ſeuerall wayes of Children and ſeruants. God himſelfe is the father from whom <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. <hi>all families are called:</hi> and he will take account of our Baylywick in this kinde. If <hi>Miniſters cannot guide their owne families, how much leſſe Gods Church?</hi> Let or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of family flow from well ordered hearts of our owne: neither too remeſſe as <hi>Eli</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.23.24. nor yet harſh, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and tyrannous, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.9. but euen <hi>framed for this very thing,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. with temper of gifts to gouerne, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe, grauity, pureneſſe and tenderneſſe: Be not as Tygres in the hot purſuit of your owne earthly buſineſſe, letting Gods
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177956:170"/> go at large, both on Sabbaths and otherwiſe: nouriſh no euill in your hearts that might breake out in example: for what child or inferiour can honour them that carry looſe hearts to God, and ſet him not vp in the family? Let God rule your children and ſeruants, and wiues, and ſet vp his throne in their Conſcience, and then a twyned thred will draw more than a cable. Aboue all, with <hi>Dauid,</hi> purge out all the bane of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, lying, vnfaithfulneſſe, vnſeaſonable riot, and the like: and let thy eye be fixed chiefely vpon the righteous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them that they may bee the guides to the reſt. Vſe not to dally out the ſeaſon of dutie in families, which procures commonneſſe and formality. Catechiſe, admoniſh, reward and cenſure, and hold vp order by theſe meanes.</p>
                  <p>Touching inferiors, bee wholly for the good of the whole family, not your owne ends: Children downe right in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and not inſolent, ſpenders and claymers of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents wealth as theirs, for the ſupport of their vices and luſts: but vnder authority with all loue and well deſeruing; ſeeing they can haue but al after the deceaſe of Parents, and the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt their due education: As for ſeruants, I haue elſewhere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large, let this ſuffice that they ſhew all good faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reſpect, as thoſe vpon whom the well or ill fare of the family dependeth, and the more they are betruſted, the more truſty: for few families doe ruinate, wherein bad ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue not one principall hand.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>One word more of the tongue, and ſo end?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It's a great wheele alſo of Conuerſation. As great wheeles in fire-works ſet the leſſer on fire, ſo doth the tongue the <hi>whole courſe of mortality, Iam</hi> 3.6. and it's ſet on fire by hell without grace. But euen where there is grace, how little ſeene in this kind? and yet our <hi>religion is in vaine without it,</hi> as <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.26. It's the chiefe Agent and chapman of conuerſation, and by it conuerſation vtters it ſelfe. But how? what ſcolding and brawlings in family? what multitude of them in buying and ſelling? what iangling vp and downe the ſtreetes by gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding goſſips of vnſtayed minds? what poiſon foames from the heart by the vent of a lying, cruell, malicious, taunting, backbiting, pratling, vaine and unruly tongue? And while the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177956:170"/> eare is the receiuer, this theefe will neuer change his trade. Truly, as once at ſea, an owner of a ſhip cryed cryed out when his ſhip was toſſed and in danger, Oh, ſaue my ſhip! one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, If it be yours, why doe ye not rule it? ſo we may ſay, our tongues are ours for title, but their own for gouernment, we haue no keep of them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That the eternall platforme after which this Conuerſation of the next Creature is to bee framed is onely the law of God in the tenne Commandements. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>the end of the Law is Loue.</hi> What end meanes he? ſurely not the end of the Lawes begetting power (for Chriſt doth that) but of the directing power of it. Thus Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calles it a <hi>Royal Law, Iam.</hi> 2.8. as being the Scepter whereby Chriſt our King rules vs. And he termes it a <hi>Glaſſe of libertie:</hi> meaning to all beleeuers, in that it ſhews forth the will of God fully in the point of moral obedience, as a glaſſe repreſents the face. So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Thy Law is perfect, giueth light to blind eyes; by it thy ſeruant is forewarned, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. <hi>Thy word is a light and lanterne to my feete and ſteps. And thy Commandements are to mee inſtead of Councellors.</hi> And of this part of the Word is that of <hi>Peter</hi> meant, <hi>The ſure Word of Prophets, ſhining in darke place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How comes this direction to be put into the word? and how comes it to be conueyed vnto the ſoule?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. To the former I anſwere, the Lord God hath breathed into it this light and direction: himſelfe put it into it, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being able in ſo few words as ten. <hi>Dut.</hi> 10.4. to contriue ſo perfect a view of all duty: and hauing out of the depth of his wiſedome ſo doe, <hi>God ſpake theſe words,</hi> although deliuered by the Miniſtery of Angels in point of attendance and terror,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177956:173"/> 
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>He maketh his Miniſters a flame of fire</hi>) hee himſelfe, as the Lord of the Creature, vttered them. And both deuiſed and vttered this Law for this eſpeciall and laſt end, to bee a direction vnto his Church.</p>
                  <p>For the latter I ſay, That as in the Law he tooke order, that not onely the Prieſts and Leuites at Ieruſalem in the Temple, but in the Tribes ſhould <hi>reade it each Sabbath, Act.</hi> 13.27. and expound it, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.4. ſo ſtill he requires that the Miniſters of the Goſpell doe diſpence and open it to the people in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall parts and ſcopes thereof, for a patterne of life. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch common notions of dim light remaine in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature as may ſerue to condemne the contemners, yet, no ſuch as might leade on to godlineſſe and ſalvation cleerely, that is a myſtery and muſt be vnfolded. And further, the Lord hath added the miniſtery of the Spirit to the voyce of man, to <hi>write this Law in the ſoule:</hi> he hath promiſed it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.33. and doth dayly performe it: ſo that to the beleeuer his Law is not a commanded one (as to all) but a commanding one, in their ſpirit and conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But this ſeemes contrary to the Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the</hi> Law was not given to the righteous, but to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This is anſwered by the ſame place, verſe 5. as in the firſt queſtion I ſaid: the ſunne is, It is not giuen to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as to the vngodly: for the righteous need it not ſo, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it's giuen to the godly alſo for another end,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> euen to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them. For the Law in Gods purpoſe ſerued for two ends: The for tranſgreſſions: to conuince the wicked, to ſcare them out of their ſelfe-conceit, and to driue them to Chriſt: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to guide ſuch as are come to Chriſt, how to lye vnder his Gouernment: This latter, the Lord looked at more mainely, for his elect ſake, that they ſhould not bee left to themſelues. But the former, alſo hee intended to the drawing of them out of their ignorance. For as we ſee, that the Law was giuen in all terror, and not as a meſſenger of good things: ſo the Lord taught thereby that it ought to ſpeake ſadly as a miniſter of death to the vngodly; and ſo it did in ſome ſort with ſuch as were ſaued among the Iewes: the Miniſtry of it conuinced
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177956:174"/> them of an impoſſibility of performance of it, and ſent them to the bleſſed ſeed who ſhould bring in righteouſneſſe, and breake the Serpents head: and to ſuch, this Law ceaſed to be a <hi>killing letter,</hi> and began to be a Cirection to life. In which ſence we here treate of it, as in the firſt part of the Catechiſme of the former.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what needes this Law-direction? Doe wee not by this, teach people to ſerue in the old letter, and deſtroy that Law of liberty in Chriſt, which ought to be ſet vp, and reſtore the couenant which ought to be aboliſhed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To anſwere both: firſt, the Lord hath not giuen his Church to Chriſt, nor giuen them any ſuch liberty in Chriſt, as to deuiſe a way to themſelues, feuerall (either for meaſure or number, or matter of obedience) from his owne way: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will truſt man with any ſuch, no nor giue the leaſt hint to mans corrupt inuentions. But that Law of obedience which hee firſt himſelfe deuiſed, hee meant it for thoſe that ſhould beleeue, both before, at, and after the comming of Chriſt: and meant not to alter it. How Chriſt rules by it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſhall heare anon: but hee rules by no other. And its worth our noting that the firſt Sermons he euer preached, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and 6 and 7. hee vrgeth nothing more than this. <hi>Thinke yee I am come to deſtroy the law? No, but to fulfill it, and to ſettle it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſecond point, I ſay, that it muſt be explayned; what it is to ſerue in the letter: and ſecondly, what it is to reſtore that which is worne out. <hi>To ſerue in the letter</hi> then, is to bee miſtaken in the ſcope of the Law, <hi>Doe this and liue:</hi> to thinke that the Law giues life to the obeyers of the letter of it, and to thinke a man may of himſelfe obey it, and bee ſaued by it; whereas the Law imports no ſuch thing, but vrges an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exactly,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>atter part.</note> which is impoſſible: now to ſerue thus, is to ſerue like a ſlaue, without reward. Thus doe not wee affirme the Law to be ſerued: Secondly, to reſtore a Law to bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, is to maintaine this error that by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> a man may be iuſtified and needes no other: and to oppoſe it to Chriſt in the point of being ſo iuſtified. This doe not wee in affirming the Law to be our direction; for wee affirme that a man is firſt iuſtified by Chriſt onely, aboliſhing the Law in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177956:174"/> that point wholly. Therefore this cauill is falſely caſt vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Explane this better: for you ſeeme herein to confound the two couenants, Do this, and liue: and,</hi> Beleeue this and liue: <hi>doe you not ſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> God forbid: for the opening of which, it will be fit in a word to ſhew in what reſpect theſe two couenants are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and in what, not: The old couenant is contrary to the new only in the point of liuing, by doing or beleeuing, and being iuſtified by doing or beleeuing. Whoſoeuer will be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by doing, deſtroyes iuſtification by beleeuing, as both thoſe old hereticall Phariſees and now Papiſts affirme. As the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. vrgeth, <hi>If of workes no more of grace, for ſo workes were no more workes: if of grace, not of workes,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sundry waies. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by diſcharging vs from the yoke of ſuperfluous ceremonies of the old ceremoniall and iudicial Law. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances, which was contrary to vs.</hi> In this wee got a great quittance of the Law, The more wrong doe they vnto vs who reſtore this burden (as the papiſts) and thinke they doe vs a good turne, deſtroying Chriſts eaſe: who hath rid vs of all <hi>beggerly Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Gal.</hi> 4.9. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>ſo that we are dead with Chriſt from them.

By which meanes theſe commandements are not <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.3.

                  <p>Q. <hi>What hath he done for vs as a King?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.

                     </gap> eaſineſſe and delight, hee may more equally and duely require it, without excuſe. And by this the Law is the more eſtabliſhed in vs, <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then by faith fruſtrate the Law? nay, rather we eſtabliſh it.</hi> For as the Lord requires obedience of his Creature, vpon the planting of his image in it: ſo, by this reſtoring it from her ruine and curſe, he much more ſettles the ſame vpon the beleeuer; faith (to ſay the truth) being the grace that conformes the ſoule to this image in the vtmoſt intent of God: which when ſhee hath perfectly done, ſhee ſhall bee of no more vſe. To this end pertaines that, <hi>Roman.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſſe, to all that beleeue.</hi> Meaning, that the Law is ſatisfied in her ſcope of perfect obedience by Chriſt: ſeeing faith in him hath obteyned a ful acceptance of obedience, as if it were legally perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> he doth by his Kingdome infuze ſtrength into vs to obey the Law: enclines our wits thereunto, and makes it to vs actually as Chriſt found it to himſelfe, and hath made it to vs, euen perfect freedome: yea, meate and drinke:<note place="margin">Ier. 31.33.

                  <p>Q. <hi>What hath he done for vs as our Prophet?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> His Prophecy commeth yet neerer to the matter in hand; for although all that I have ſaid be to be ſuppoſed, ere the Law can direct vs; yet the actuall worke of direction iſſueth from his Prophecie: And <hi>firſt</hi> by a Declaring, and <hi>ſecondly</hi> by a Reuealing Worke. The Declaring worke is a witneſſing to the ſoule that he is the true Lord and Comman-of his People, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.4. that he rules his law as by his ſcepter, that all his Preiſthood and merit ends in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and obedience, that it is his honour that <hi>all knees bow to him,</hi> and that they <hi>kiſſe the Sonne;</hi> that hee is the obiect of it through whom the Father is honoured: that true Liberty ſtands not in hauing our wil, but in putting on this yoke; and who ſo doth otherwiſe, deceives himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by his Reuealing worke: by this hee directs the ſoule, and ſets the ſteps of it, (as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.79) in peace: by this he vſes the tenor of his Law to be a liuely finger to point out duty for euery occaſion, and to frame the ſoule to draw his Law to euery need and vſe in the life, according to that, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2 20.27. <hi>Ye haue an vnction from the Holy one, who telleth you all things:</hi> And in <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.21. <hi>Their eares ſhall heare a voyce behinde them,</hi> ſaying; <hi>This is the way, walke in it.</hi> This is a Revealing with direction; by which the ſoule ſees the vſe of Chriſt in euery Commandement, and is led on by him as her Guide thereby, as if an Oracle ſhould ſpeake from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. <hi>A Leader and Commander to his people, verſ.</hi> 4. And thus a Chriſtian may ſee how the Commandements of the Morall Law are the directions of Chriſt, and how he is the Law-giver of the ſoule in them all; and till this bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, it is no wonder if we account them as a ſtrange thing, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.12. But by this meanes, familiar.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>I conceiue now, how Chriſt hath made his Law a directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to godly life; now come to the directions themſelues, what are they?</hi>

                  <p>Q <hi>Mention then ſome of theſe Rules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that all the Lawes of Chriſt muſt be vnderſtood to be of another manner of force and authority than the Lawes of men, euen the greateſt: for they are limited with exceptions in all kindes, and doe but reach to the outward man, and penalties thereof. But theſe doe reach to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and they binde the inner man: <hi>God, whom wee haue to doe with,</hi> ſeeing the ſoule (in her vtmoſt retiredneſſe) as a thing <hi>naked, Heb.</hi> 4.13. and his word being pure as himſelfe, and piercing betweene the ioynts and marrow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. and therefore there he ſets vp his Throne, and there is no eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:177956:177"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let vs know that his Commands are not idle things and arbitrary, which we may obey at our curteſie; or if not, yet God is as a weake King for whom his Subjects are too ſtrong, as <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ai</hi> for <hi>David;</hi> but reall Lawes from an authority that both knowes offenders, and can pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; yea, which accurſeth all tranſgreſſours, and will not hold them guiltleſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. a conſuming fire,</hi> as the manner of his uttering them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. in earthquakes and thunder ſhewed; and therefore be we afraid to provoke him: and yet he is a God able to gratifie his obedient ones, in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, even to a thouſand generations: and its not to be neglected that both kind of ſanctions are expreſſed in ſo ſhort a view.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> obſerue, that the commands of the ſecond Table are the edicts of the ſame God whoſe the firſt are, <hi>Iam.</hi> 12.11. and therefore in which the Lord takes himſelfe as much either honoured or not as the firſt: which I ſpeake leſt any ſhould cavill and thinke that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>(If man ſinne againſt man, a man may iudge; but if againſt the Lord, who ſhall entreat)</hi> to be meant of morall offences. No, but onely of common diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies and offences, or breaches which are in mens power to releaſe. For even thoſe ſinnes of <hi>Eli's</hi> Sonnes were againſt women: and yet he tels them, the Lord tooke them as againſt himſelfe. So that although men be the object of the ſecond Table, yet not the laſt, into which the morrall offence is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and therefore it is not in man to releaſe any more of it then his owne damage, the reſt the Lord onely can remit: as the ſinne is of equall guilt, ſo the forgiver muſt be of equall power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Law muſt be alwayes underſtood according to the ſcope, even as every other part of the Word, as promiſes and threats. Wee muſt not reſt in the bare letter, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrow the life and ſpirit of the Law. How ſhoud ten words include all our converſation, except the letter of the Law be enlarged to the meaning of the Law-giver? The Law then reſts in the true intent of it: Therefore, as for all Phariſaicall, licentious, or prophane wretches; who doe limit this Law, and acknowledge no more then ſerues for their purpoſes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177956:177"/> chopping and changing (as Papiſts, who leaue out the ſecond Commandement quite, and make vp tenne by making two of the laſt) let vs abhor it. Let vs abhor both their enlarging of duties beyond the Law, &amp; where God hath made no ſins, there making ſinnes: and where he makes no Lawes, making them to bind the Conſcience, vrging them more ſeuerely than faith and repentance. Oh! it's moſt intollerable! And ſo their ſhortning of them, and cutting them off by the middle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reach no further then the notorious euils of them: But let this be our rule, that look what God aymes at vnder the groſſeſt, let vs alſo ayme at, and both abhorre each appearance of euill as well as the moſt odious, and cleauing to good in the leaſt as well as the greateſt. He that <hi>breakes the leaſt, Matth.</hi> 5.19. <hi>ſhall be the leaſt in heauen;</hi> and is guilty of the greateſt. If the ſcope of the ſecond Commandement be (next to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it ſelfe) to prouide for the purity of it, any will-worſhip ſhould be to vs as an Idoll: and all rebellion, as witch-craft, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> we muſt conceiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements as importing no patcht or peeced obedience to one or a few charges, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and whole one: as the coagmentation of the Lawes of both Tables doth import. Let vs alway conceiue the ſcope of the Law to require integrity; and all partiall ſeruice to bee a forfeit to the whole Law: and be farre from all ſuch hipocrits and Ciuilians, of whom the one colours his vnrighteouſneſſe by his pretenſed deuotion (which men cannot controle) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their impiety and prophannes of their hearts, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ciuility in ſome of the Commandements of the ſecond Table: both in truth breaking both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the Lawes of the former Table are generally to bee preferred to the duties of the ſecond: yet with an exception, that we conceiue it upon equall tearmes: thus, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the firſt ranke in the former table haue precedency ouer the ſecond, not each branch of the former aboue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in their firſt ranke. It is generally more excellent that God haue his due then man: not particularly, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or contempt of a Sermon is a fouler ſin than the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a man.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:177956:178"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> Vnderſtand the commandements to require at our hands the vtmoſt of our wit, deuiſe and courage to ſerue God: that if we be beaten off in one kind, yet wee deſiſt not, till we ſee that we be denied altogether. Elſe, to take any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of perill, (perhaps ſuppoſed onely) to neglect duty, is, to diſcharge our ſelues of ſeruice, ere God doth.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Let vs obſerue, the Commandements of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer croſſe each other: if any ſuch caſe occurre, as wherein one cannot ſtand with the other, let vs know the one muſt alway yeeld to the other: as, if the child bee ſet about his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lawfull buſineſſe, hee may not at the ſame time neglect his calling, though to a religious end, as to heare the word, &amp;c. except the parent releaſe him: the prerogatiue of the firſt Table aboue the ſecond, notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let vs note this, that duties of neceſſity and mercy which cannot be otherwiſe done, are to be preferred to duties of piety, at that ſeaſon: as the Phiſition to attend the patient, or to help the Oxe out of the ditch, rather than worſhip God firſt, and ſuffer theſe to deſpaire the whileſt: Obedience in ſuch caſes is better than ſacrifice: and the omiſſion of a duty is no contempt with God. But I ceaſe to mention any more, ſeeing it's leſſe to my purpoſe.</p>

It was a good ſpeech of old, They are the beſt Lawes which giue leaſt power to the Iudge. God will haue no Iudge to be his Chancellor, to make or interpret, or change Lawes, he knowes our boldneſſe and Sacriledge in this kind. Nay, hee knowes that curioſity of our braines, which being weary of his Lawes, deviſe new, and loue their owne better than his: and ſo in time iuſtle out the Lords with our owne. And as we can open our mouthes againſt Papiſts in this kind, ſo let vs hate them in the roote, and caſt out of our ſelues all ſuch ſelfe and ſelfe-loue as vnder a colour of reteyning Gods Lawes, yet ſeeke a breadth of our owne in his narrow, and make his Lawes our owne, through our bad mixtures. This is the ſinne of hipocrites and time-ſeruers; let vs (if wee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) ſtudy this Law of God duely, and when we ſee his will (which is as the decrees of Medes and Perſians) let vs not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant vpon it, and nibble at as a fiſh at the bate, being fearefull of the hooke: ſtriuing by the rottenneſſe of our deceiued heart to bring Gods Lawes to the bent of our owne bowes, and corrupt them in the ſimplicity of them. There is little oddes betweene the carnall wil-worſhip of them that thruſt vpon the Lord, their owne: and the ſpirituall wil-worſhip of them that take away from him, his.

What was this but to make the Lords charge a noſe of waxe? was it poſſible the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe could ſtoope to a law of couetouſneſſe? Beware wee of this hipocriſie, leaſt while we dally with God, when we know it, the Lord ſuffer vs to daſh out our owne light and lay of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in our way, and leaue vs to our ſelues, that as hee when he would needes go with them, and fetch inchantments from place to place, yet being dazeled and beſotted with his owne luſt, ſhould not know himſelfe to be an hipocrite nor be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conuiction; what is more terrible then to heare ſuch an

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> it be vſe of exhortation to all Gods people to embrace it, and to ſubmit to this ſcepter of Chriſt, to eſtabliſh his Law in our ſoules, and to lift vp him in the honour of our hearts, who hath honoured vs with this royall Law to bee our direction. Let vs deſire information in it: let vs beware leaſt we ſhrug at the naked, inward and ſpirituall truths of it, as afraid to know that which we are lother to obey: but let vs concurre with him, and ſay, Lord, <hi>thy Scepter is a Scepter of righteouſneſſe, Heb.</hi> 1.8. I deſire no obedience ouer or vnder, againſt or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide thy Laws; I count that no ſinne which thou neuer forbad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, nor duty which thou neuer requiredſt: but eſteeme thy ſacred will my rule of righteouſneſſe. It is one maine piece of the trade of an honeſt heart to ſearch out the Lawes of the Lord Ieſus, that it might obey. Many teachable hearts who would faine obey, yet faile in knowledge; and many that haue knowledge, faile in a good heart: the latter is worſt, yet makes not the former excuſable. The Iewes in the point of the Law were ſo curious that they knew how many words were in <hi>Moſes</hi> his bookes. <hi>They wrote theſe tenne words</hi> vpon parchment phylacteries (that is preſeruatiues) and pind them to their ſleeues, fringes and frontlets, in reuerence. If they did ſo (who for the moſt part little gained thereby, but ſinned, with their parchments about them) what ſhould wee doe whom the Lord Ieſus hath made them eaſie yokes vnto, and a light burden? If they did ſo, who yet in their ſo doing, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for an erroneous iuſtification by them, and were but meere ſlaues, looſing their rewards, what ſhould our zeale be, who know our ſelues to be free from this bondage, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey with aſſurance of heauen? Oh! let vs not bee worſe then good common-wealthſ-men! we ſhall ſee (perhaps) in a great towne, ſome one among forty houſholds buy the Statutes of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:177956:179"/> the land, and verſe them well ouer, and be able to tell their neighbours what is law and what not; and theſe are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men of good vſe among ignorant ones? But how would God eſteeme vs for good ſubiects if theſe Lawes of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were well conned? if (as we teach our children to ſay them, ſo) wee our ſelues vnderſtood them. If the Lord would ſo honor his royall Law, that hee would haue the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who made lawes to their ſubiects, yet to be learners of his Lawes: and not to ſuffer his to depart from them in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of others: how farre greater cauſe haue meane perſons to carry it with them into each part of their owne conuerſation, and to riſe vp, walke into the trade of their life, lye down with it? It is reported by Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> of one <hi>Crow,</hi> a ſea-man, that beeing in ſhipwrake, and hauing caſt all his tacklings and wares, and fiue pounds of mony into the ſea, hee kept his new Teſtament about his necke, ſo ſwimming vpon his broken maſt, and after foure dayes (all his company being drowned) yet he was at length by paſſengers diſcouered and taken vp all frozen, numb'd and ſteruen; but yet his booke he held cloſe to him. If we in the ſhipwraks of this world, would keepe our ſoules from wracke, what courſe ſhould we take? Surely keepe this law to vs cloſe, and not ſuffer it to depart from vs: looſe money, wares, ſhip and all, ere we forgoe that, leaſt we looſe our conſcience, and diſorder our conuerſation. And in all our doubtfull caſes, whither vowes, oathes, marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, dealings with men, entercourſe with God or any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, go to the Law &amp; teſtimony, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.20. for reſolution? If our own skill ſerue not to find out the will of God, then let vs go to the Prieſt whoſe lips ſhould preſerue knowledg, &amp; by that rule proceed? Many will do ſo, but either they deſire to miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Miniſter that they may peruert the iudgment; or elſe <hi>firſt vow and then enquire, Pro.</hi> 20.25. both which are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

So that the Lord is no hard Maſter to his people and Church, but tendereth it moſt fatherly, and is not wanting thereto in any furniture, which any one member thereof needeth for the building of her vp in grace. The Lord is not as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who tyrannouſly exacted the ſame <hi>tale of his Bricke</hi> when the Iſraelites <hi>wanted Straw,</hi> as when they had. But rather deales with vs as with his people in their paſſage from Egypt to Canaan, as he would bring them by the way of the Wilderneſſe farre about and difficult: ſo he ſtucke cloſe to them in their trauell.

                     <hi>A.</hi> It is not for us to meddle with his ſecrets, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. revealed things are for us: what hee can doe by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power, where theſe helpes are denied, we leave to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but in ordinary courſe we ſay, that the Lord doth tye himſelfe to his owne way of working, that ſo wee know where to have him: and he doth in like ſort tye us (in the matter of our calling and building up) to theſe meanes, that we might not vaniſh in other wayes or deviſes of our owne.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thus; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the ſoule knowing that God doth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine her by the ſame whereby he begat her, doth, vpon this Baptiſme receiued, with holy confidence goe to the Lord for her due nouriſhment by, and in him: Saying thus, <hi>Oh Lord</hi> I <hi>am thine, ſave mee, Pſal.</hi> 119.94. Of thee I am, <hi>who art made vnto me, not onely Righteouſneſſe, but Sanctification,</hi> with growth and encreaſe in it: I come therefore to plead my right in all humility. If I had neuer come to birth, or to the light, I had ſo bin at an end; but ſeeing thou haſt not denied me the life of a child of thine, doe not leaue mee to ſhift, but Lord bring mee vp at thy coſt, and let mee haue my portion from thy Table, and my daily bread from thy hand. And as a good Parent thinkes it little to keepe the life of his childe, that it ſterue not; but hee allowes all things for comfort, as well as neede, (if hee be able) that it may liue, and proſper, and grow vp and be like in him, and enioy what hee hath to giue it when the due time is come; ſo, O Lord, deale thou, (much more) with thy ſeruant in Grace, till Glory.

As thou art in the Father, ſo let mee bee thine; as thou art Gods, let mee be Chriſts; dwell thou in mee, and let mee dwell in thee by

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Prepare thy ſoule to this feaſt, of the mountains, <hi>Eſay</hi> 25. as oft as thou commeſt, (which muſt be oft, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30.) and come not without thy feaſt Apparell. And let this be one Rule vnto thee, Doe not catch vp this Robe on the ſudden; but weare it daily betweene Sacrament and Sacrament. Thy father is a King, who can beteeme and maintaine thee to weare thy beſt clothes each day of the weeke, and make thy Friday better than the poore mans holiday. That faith in the Lord Ieſus thou walkeſt, or woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come with to the Supper, liue by it daily: Chriſt is the ſame in the promiſe, and the Seale. That Repentance thou walkeſt with to the Sacrament, practiſe it daily: better is a Souldier taken out of a Garriſon, than new preſt. That bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart thou wouldeſt faine haue in the ſearching and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of thy ſinnes, nouriſh daily: he that in a great froſt would keepe the yee thin, muſt keepe it broken euery day: So thou, thy ſoule-iſſues, leſt thine heart harden. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thou haſt after Chriſt Sacramentall, or wouldeſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the promiſe daily, hunger and thirſt each houre after him; elſe it will not be with thy ſoule as with thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that many hungry meales will make the next a glutton; but rather thy emptineſſe will make thee ſenſeleſſe of it. If thou wouldeſt not thinke it a burthen to doe thus, Oh how ſweet ſhould preparation to the Supper bee to thee, which now is tedious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Being thus come to the Supper, ſet thy faith on worke; ſay thus, I know no Deuill in hell can ſeuer Ieſus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell, my meat and drinke, from theſe Elements; but his Word hath vnited them for euer. Why, oh my ſoule, hath the Lord care of Bread and Wine? Or is it, that by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall vnion with them (as ſenſible) he might vnite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with me ſpiritually and really in this Seale of his; that my impatient, worldly, dead, diſtruſtfull heart might bee purged, and I filled with the Lord Ieſus my Food and Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue in all graces of Regeneration, and that in a full feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Seeing him there thine, take him, eat and drinke him, and enioy him; let thy ſoule apply him to thee for that thou lackeſt, and hee ſerueth; that is, to ſupply thy wants where the hedge is loweſt with thee, to pare off thy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous part, to fill vp and ſupply thy decayes and voydneſſe; I meane ſuch gifts or graces as concerne thee either in thy particular calling, or in thy generall: beware thou doe not ſtreighten this feaſt, bring not thy owne browne bread in thy pocket, ſcant not his bounty, but take it as hee offers it; by ſo much the more meet for him to giue, by how much more thou unworthy. And how much this feaſt ſeemes in thy eye to come ſhort of Popiſh Maſſe-Chriſt, (for they giue him to God, and take none of him from God,) by ſo much the more let it be to thee a ſpirituall Banquet of all <hi>refined Wines, and fat things;</hi> and if thou canſt feed with the Saints, thou needſt care for Papiſts, whom if thou didſt ſup with, they would robbe thee of thy drinke, which were to choke thee with thy meat.</p>

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Leſt thou ſhouldſt ſtagger about thy right and part herein, remember the end of the Sacrament is to rid thee of this feare. For why? it is Gods ſeale to the Couenant of his Grace, to make thee his Sonne and Daughter, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee: its his vttermoſt ſecurity for any outward one; nay, its his Inſtrument of conveying the greateſt meaſure of his Spirit vnto thee: Diſtruſt him not in his cheefe euidence. As a man when hee hath ſealed up, deliuered his writings, and giuen vp the poſſeſſion of all to thee, can doe no more; ſo, this is Gods vttermoſt evidence, whereby he hath made Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus thy Sanctification, and grouth in it, as ſure as heauen can make it.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>May the like be ſaid of the reſt, either publike, or priuate; as reading, ſinging of Pſalmes, conference, prayer, meditation? if yea, then ſhew how, and firſt of prayer.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> For Prayer, (in a word to touch it, and gather one or two eares out of an harueſt of matter) let me be conceiued to ſpeak of it in each kind, (ſauing due reſpects) for breuity ſake: <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Retaine this heauenly ordinance of God in that due eſteeme which the Lord hath graced it with; for all ends both of humiliation and ſupplication.

Maintaine and hold this right and Title of thine. Thinke not that this Spirit of Grace and Supplication is ſpent, though thou ſee not God ſo clearely in it for all ends, as thou deſireſt; yet giue it not ouer: thy ſinne hath bound thee in cheynes, but Prayer is not bound; rather it bindeth the Lord by promiſe to thee. The <hi>eare of God is not heauy, that hee ſhould not heare:</hi> Hee is not as a man, that he ſhould be diſtracted by multitude of praying Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at once? a thouſand to him are as one, and one as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Goe in the Lord Ieſus by a promiſe, hauing thy wants in a readineſſe, and thy faith on wing: let not thy courſe in praying iſſue from a formall platforme (though I iudge not any man for reading a prayer) but a liuely feeling, and humble pinching of ſoule for thy Neceſſities.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſhake off all extremities of a corrupt heart, by faith, which muſt hold thine eye fixed upon thy Mediator (by his Spirit vpholding thy faintneſſe, and groning within thee) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thy preſumptions, commonneſſe, dulneſſe, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, coldneſſe, and beſeech the Lord to ſtirre thee vp to pray as he ſhall ſuggeſt vnto thee, by the preſent occaſion (well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted) either for the Church, others, or thy ſelfe.

Come not to the Lord with either an heart moyling and lowring with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, without faith; or bold and ventrous without humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; but let both haue their due weight. If thou wouldeſt be heauenly in prayer, firſt abaſe thy ſelfe as a worme, duſt and aſhes, yea (as Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi>) hell and the ſinke-hole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord who is heauen and holineſſe: if the Lord haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeciall draught for thy net, he will put thee out of conceit with thy owne Art, and thy ſelfe, as <hi>Peter</hi> was when hee had toiled all night, and catcht nothing.

If in prayer thou finde little ſtirring, know it is not becauſe Prayer is not Gods Ordinance, but he would try whether forme, and the worke done, bee not aboue ſpirit and faith in thee: if they be not, perſiſt and goe againſt the edge of thy owne deadneſſe, reſting in that meaſure gladly which the Lord ſees beſt; for in this caſe thou wilt pray oftneſt, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> (and aboue all) come not to pray with any tainted knowne ſin: I ſay not onely groſſe, but euen ſecret and cloſe, through a lazy heart loth to caſt them off; or a looſe heart, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them better than the things thou prayeſt for; leſt the Lord iuſtly leaue thee to be weariſome to him and thy ſelfe. Caſt out thy wrath, and earth, and diſdaine, and cenſures, and vncharitableneſſe; yea, let thy praying awe thee againſt them ere thou pray, that it may arme thee when thou haſt done. Til prayer become thy familiar friend, &amp; bring thee <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquaintance with God,</hi> for a ſupply of wants, pardon of daily ſinnes, helpe for all duties of conuerſation. And ſo looking vp to thine Aduocate for a couering of thy weakeneſſe, this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177956:188"/> duty ſhall be a ſpeciall helpe to godlineſſe vnto thee. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Prayer, I ſend my Reader to the ſpeciall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Adde ſomewhat of meditation, and leaue the reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Touching this Ordinance, I may call it the high-way to all good conuerſation: yea, I may ſay, it's as the ſmoke of the ſacrifice, in which the Angell, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13.20. went up to heauen in: I ſet it not aboue prayer, but magnifie it, to ſet an edge vpon people, who will not know it. And ſurely, if that be an helpe to God, which both takes away lets, and both in the act and effects of it, is ſo admirable, iudge what an helpe meditation is. Tell mee then, firſt, what are the cheefe lets to grace (in them who (otherwiſe) want not knowledge;) Surely, either giddineſſe of mind, or vnſavourineſſe of ſpirit: The former like a ſieve out of the water, loſeth all it gets, ſuffers nothing, either truths heard, or workes ſeene, to abide long in the heart. But Meditation ſettles them in the Spirit, that they leake not out, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. Thus the life of a thouſand Sermons of mercies and occaſions is preſerued. In ſtead of the latter, it ſeaſons the heart with the ſap, the life, the ſavour of good things. They are not heaps upon heaps, leauing vs a thirſt, but we drink of them, digeſt them, and make our ſoules merry with them: Euen as an enuious man ſo long chewes the cud of his malice in his bed, till hee haue het his heart, and deuiſed reuenge; ſo is meditation a reall grace (on the contrary) and whetteth vpon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and works of God, till it be fired with the love of them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it makes the meaning, view, ſcope, and order both of particular doctrines, and the whole frame of Religion to become our owne.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> wee come hereby to the eaſe of practice; the fruit hereof, Experience; ſo that if once we haue found croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to doe vs good, wee feare not when new ones approach: if wee haue felt the gaine of a Sabbath, we get a delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: in a word, whatſoeuer is eaſie, it becomes ſweete: and therefore if this be worth ſomewhat to find the yoke of God eaſie, and his burthen light, (as to ſay the truth, it is the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of goodneſſe) well may wee then ſay, Meditation is a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177956:189"/> diuine helpe to a good courſe. Oh! how its to bee lamented that men know it not? they get no matter to chew vpon: they ſeperate not themſelues to it, (thinking they may medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate while they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And firſt that of Faſting. Of which I ſay this, that if wee eſteeme that receit aboue all which doth cure a diſeaſe, that no other medicine could, then ſurely faſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues account. Our Sauiour tels vs, <hi>This kinde of Diuels goeth not out,</hi>

                     <hi>ſaue by faſting and prayer;</hi> that is, all the ordinances of God are effectuall, but this aboue all, for this end. Wherefore (briefely) whither we bring the Churches, or our owne caſes, either ſinnes or ſorrowes before the Lord to be done away.</p>
                  <p>Let vs firſt, arme our ſelues to the chiefe worke, which is ſoule-affliction. Let vs conſider, if we were pined with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of abſtinence from meat and drinke for any time, what a fearefull anguiſh would it bring vs vnto? and is not (thinke wee) ſinne that deſerues it of more afflicting vexing nature? Oh! if we could preuaile with God to feele this ſting in kind, how ſweet ſhould a faſt bee? and how ſapleſſe is it, when we can ſcarce in a whole day feele one dart of ſinne or wrath to pierce vs? Let vs ayme at it then, and much more that ſinne doe humble vs then any ſorrow whatſoeuer. Let vs firſt <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9. <hi>beare the indignation of the Lord for our ſinne;</hi> and for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt, let God alone to plead our cauſe: for what ſhould it help vs to be rid of all other enemies, while our owne pride, ſelfe-loue, hipocriſie vaine-glory, worldlineſſe, and hardneſſe of heart ſtill glow at our hearts? Therefore as poore <hi>Vriah</hi> was faint to be ſet in the forefront before his fellowes: ſo let vs ſet theſe before all enemies; that if any dart, any ſtrength from heauen be ſent vs, theſe may haue the firſt handſell thereof; for the ſtrength of all our ſorrowes and enemies lyes in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therefore let vs ſo lye vnder the affliction and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177956:189"/> of theſe, that the Lord may bow his heart to be afflicted in all our ſorrowes: and then he will ſoone bow the heauens and melt our calamities away: although they ſeeme as mountains yet they ſhal flow down at his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64.1. yet let vs not onely doe thus: remember that faſting is alſo a Sabbath of reconciliation: therefore let the Lord Ieſus his Redemption be looked at by faith, and keepe vs from baſe bondage and the feare of hipocrites. Let vs beleeue that vpon one croſſe he both ſatisfied for our ſinnes, and conquered all enemies: and therefore in his merit let vs confidently approach to the throne of grace for pardon of the one, and deliuerance from the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> apply ourſelues to all the ſupports of a faſt, which the Lord hath granted to keepe vs from deadneſſe and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Word I meane fitted to our occaſions, and the like, yet as ſeruing to the maine of humiliation and confidence. Adore we the Lord in his owne ſtrong way and our vtter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Let vs bleſſe him, that we be freed from thoſe Popiſh dumbe Pageants (who beſide the outward abſtinence) want all furniture of faſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> conſider that the Scripture in no one thing affords vs greater conſolation and hope than in this: for there is ſcarce one example of a faſt, which wants the experience of good ſucceſſe, yea extraordinary like it ſelfe, as in <hi>Eſters, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs</hi> and <hi>Ezraes</hi> Iſrael's againſt <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the Churches, <hi>Act</hi> 12. doth appeare. Nay let our owne experience hearten vs: when euer did we meet a new without proofe of ſome bleſſing vpon the former publike humiliation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and conſidering it muſt be no ſmall grace, either of mourning or faith which muſt preuaile againſt thoſe holds either without or within which we pray againſt; let vs know that our lockes had neede be well growne (with <hi>Sampſons</hi>) for ſuch a purpoſe. Therefore let none dare to compaſſe this Altar with vnpreparedneſſe of heart. And ſo, looking to the Lord Ieſus for couering vs, and accepting vs, let vs deſire ſome ſigne of mercy, and conſuming of our Sacrifice, that we depart with comfort and hope to haue God to ſet his <hi>fiat</hi> to our ſuites. And ſo ſhall we find faſting a ſpeciall helpe to grace.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:177956:190"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Conclude with Thanksgiuing: is that an helpe alſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea verily, if firſt, wee come full of the matter of our thanks, (for ſo are all the thanksgiuings of this kind (which the Holy Ghoſt recordeth) <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriams,</hi>

And therefore to carry a liuing memoriall and catalogue of the chiefe publike ones (of which a reuerend Writer of our Church hath deſerued well) and ſo the like briefe of our owne, were moſt needfull. Remember the great prouidence of ſetling the Goſpell and baniſhing Popery, and ſince that, the ſtrange miraculous deliuerances not once or twiſe from forraine enemies, home iudgements; In ſecret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord our owne: our firſt calling, ſince that, our many ſtaggers and reuolts: his renewed mercies by occaſion, in our changes of eſtate, in our ſtreights in deep deſertions, when wee could no more ſuſtaine our ſelues, then if we had hung in the ayre; how he hath euer been our portion when friends haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs vnthankfully, and will bee ſo ſtill: our bleſſings aboue many gifts of minde, condition and calling, graces of ſoule, how God kept vs from forſaking his Couenant in our dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt temptations of Satan and enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be enlarged accordingly with due ſimpathy both for the Church and thy ſelfe, reioycing with her with and for whom thou haſt oft mourned, and preferring her peace to thy chiefe ioy. Affection is the fire to the Sacrifice, and know that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>ult.</hi> hee that prayſeth God honoreth him: and the aſcent of prayſes ſhall be the deſcent of bleſſings, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he who may maintaine this entercourſe with God for the enlarging of him to more grace. And ſo much of the whole doctrine of the meanes.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and firſt ſeeing the chaine of theſe holy helps is ſo precious and profitable to a godlie life; firſt, wee confute all breake the linkes thereof; and vnſauorily make compariſons that betweene one and other, to the ouerthrow of all. Some betweene preaching and prayer: ſome betweene Word and Sacraments, as the Papiſts doe. How is the Sacrament of the Altar magnifyed with them? and how are all other vilified thereby? whereas we do hold that they haue a ſweet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177956:190"/> and neither without other to be ſet vp: yea, wee are to confeſſe, that each of them with the other, is better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; neither ſundred from other, Couenant from Seale, Seale from it, priuate from publike, are profitable. Let each one haue his precedency, and his prayſe: How ſhould any bee wanted, when no one hath the peculiar vſe of the other, and yet all will ſupply each others defect. Let the ſolemneſſe of the publike, the familiarity of the priuate, and the need of all, affect vs with exceeding thankfulneſſe; eſpecially for our liberty in the vſe thereof, which Popery had debarred vs of in each kind by a ſtrange tongue of Scripture, a Sacrifice for a Sacrament; yea, a confuſion of many for a few. And ſecondly, all ſuch as carry away the honour from the Ordainer, to the Ordinance, by fearefull ſacrilege; aſcribing to the bare words of Scriptures, (as the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) a coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring power to exorcize Diuels, and to the meere <hi>opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of Sacraments (the maſſe eſpecially) as great power as to Chriſt; putting the pix-bread into dead mens mouthes: thus falling in loue with the meanes, and renouncing faith to ſet vp God aboue them; whereby the true power of all Religion is turned into a meere Idol; God iuſtly blaſting that which oppoſes his glory. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, how precious and adored ſhould the Wiſedome of our God bee, in appointing ſo many, and neither more of theſe, nor leſſe than the need of his Church required: neither pampering nor ſteruing them, but nouriſhing them: Oh, I ſay, how ſhould theſe lift vs vp to God? As once an holy man riding by the Meddowes in the Spring, ſeeing and ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch variety of flowers, ſaid, Oh ſweet Creatures; but how ſweet then is your Creator?

Nay, how ought this wiſdome of God to teach us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedeme to diſcerne and make vſe of each flower in this garden of Ordinances? How lamentable is it, that to this day moſt of vs are ſo blinde in this point? Who ſees the vſe which the Law ſerues for apart from the Goſpell; to be as a needle to draw the thread after it: Who bleſſes God for the ſeuerall power of the Word, conuerting and building vp the ſoule? Who perceiues the difference of Baptiſme the Seed, and the Supper the food of the Church; or maketh vſe of both in their diuers temptations? Who knoweth (with the Bee) how to flye to each of theſe flowers for the vertue of euery one? Who goeth to ſinging of Pſalmes when hee is merry; or to pray, when afflicted; or to faſting in his ſtreights, or againſt ſuch Deuils as no other will expell? Oh how were this wiſedome to be deſired, that ſeeing theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold graces, we might in nothing be wanting?

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> to vſe them all, cloſely, conſtantly, wiſely: deſpiſe not the ſillineſſe, ſimplicity of them: iudge them not by man or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of appearance; ſeuer not the things which God hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited: hee hath ordained both their coherence, and vſe: ſeeke him in all, if by any meanes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11. we may attaine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177956:191"/> our deſire: not knowing in what box our cheefe health con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, let not one eclipſe and ſtaine the other: affect not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate to exclude publike; honour not publike, to weaken the eſteeme of priuate; extraordinary, to deſpiſe ordinary; or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to exclude them. Theſe are the vſuall humors of men: if they take a toy in their head, no other Ordinances ſhall bee in price, ſaue ſuch as they liſt. Let not the difficulty of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of haſting diſmay thee from it; but be afraid that any one of Gods Ordinances ſhould be a ſtranger to thee. Reiect none, as thou wouldeſt be ſorry to want the vſe of any: the contempt of any, will accurſe all; becauſe the charge equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concernes all. And for the neglect of the publike, (which is a common ſinne with moſt) to hunker at home, when the Word or Sacrament might be enioyed: I ſay, it is an ill marke of a thriuing Chriſtian: Grace is as fire, it muſt haue fuell, elſe it vaniſhes. No meanes, no grace: little vſe of them, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace; great vſe of them (as before qualified) great grace. I will ſpeake boldly, The Lord (in this caſe) ſells grace for labour, to an honeſt heart. If thy conuerſation be ſo poore, and thou ſo barren in the vſe of all meanes, ſtanding vp to the chinne: what wouldſt thou proue, if thou ſhouldſt quite neglect them? Euen ſtinke where thou goeſt. Set not any Ordinance aboue God; but tempt not God in refuſing, or ſcant vſing of any: Looke not to grow alone without Word and Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly (to remember my promiſe in the point of the life of faith in the ſecond Article,) let this teach vs to liue by faith in the vſe of his Ordinances: I haue already vrged it in euery of the particulars almoſt, Faſting, Hearing, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. This in generall I adde, Therefore the Lord hath not truſted vs with outward ſhewes and glory of the world, but with meane and fooliſh Ordinances to the eye of man; that our ſenſes might not pore vpon the face of things, but diue into the ſubſtance, and flye aboue them, to him that made them, and filled them with Spirit and Life, that wee might ſucke it out by a promiſe. As once an old man being asked if hee grew in goodneſſe, ſaid, Yea doubtleſſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it to be ſo, for God hath ſaid it: So, let the Ordinances
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177956:192"/> be no obiect of our ſenſe, but of faith: and let vs ſay, Lord, I beleeue thy Word can helpe me to beare my croſſes, thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments will leaue mee better than I came to them; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then mee in the inner man, not becauſe I feele it as I would, but becauſe thou haſt ſaid it. Therefore by faith, let vs cry out as the Church in the <hi>Canticles, Ariſe, O North-wind, and blow vpon theſe flowers and ſpices, that they may come into my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils;</hi> Elſe thou maiſt bee in the midſt of the Garden, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour nothing: onely that breath which put in this ſmell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, can draw it forth againe and let it in to thee, that ſo thou mayſt ſay, The word which others heard as the ſound of many waters, hath beene the ſavour of life to me, to breed me to a liuely hope. Not the words vttered, not the bare E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, but the promiſe belonging to both, is the obiect of my ſoule: He that ſaith, I <hi>will bee in the midſt of two or three, Mat.</hi> 18.20. and <hi>Mica</hi> 2.7. <hi>My Spirit is not ſtreightned, but my Word is good to them that walke uprightly:</hi> The Word is pure as the Lord himſelfe; yea, piercing the ſoule, &amp;c. is ſtill able to make good his promiſe: And ſo I may ſay of all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to the Sacraments, <hi>My Fleſh is meat indeed, and my Bloud is drinke indeed;</hi> and ſo of the reſt: therefore I conclude the whole Article thus; All theſe publike and priuate helpes ſerue to further and ripen a beleeuer in an holy conuerſation; all and euery one of them. But if I be asked, Doſt thou finde each part of thy Conuerſation to be holpen, and thy ſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by each of them; Anſwer thus, I am poore in grace, and dead-hearted, but yet for all that, I beleeue it to bee ſo, for God hath ſaid it.

                     <hi>A.</hi> That the New Creatures whole life within and without is beſet with manifold lets and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances which doe threaten to ſet him backe and hinder him in the courſe of Chriſtianity. See Texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Caſt off euery weight and clogge.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. As it was with Chriſt, after his baptiſme and annoynting, inſtantly Satan ſet upon him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1. So here, formerly wee haue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177956:192"/> ſet forth the Church of Chriſt as his Spouſe in all her abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and coſtly Bride-attire, that ſhe may be amiable in her Bridegroomes eye: we haue deſcribed her by all the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els which Chriſt hath ſent her as Loue tokens, by all her outward Ordinances, and all her inward priuileges on the right hand, and the left, within and without, to bring her to heauen: now wee change her habit, and bring her in with the mourning weed of her Widdow-hood, and in her Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Trauellers habit, with her Trewell in one hand, the Sword in her other; as the bed of ſweet violets beſet with nettles; the Lillies and Roſes, with thornes. The beſt part wee haue ſeene (or ſhall in Article 6) now wee muſt behold her at her worſt, that we may know it before-hand, and if wee will be new creatures, then reſolue vpon it; the next newes will bee lets, enemies, ſhreud turnes, and yet the Roſe is the Roſe ſtill for all theſe. And as it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the rebellion of their ſpirit made a iourney of forty dayes, to be of forty yeares; The Lord would not carry them to that good land with eaſe, through the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> land, but the Wilderneſſe, full of wild beaſts, hunger, thirſt, toyle and travell: So is it here, our vnrenued part cauſes much woe to vs, and fils our life with ſorrow; which though our good God meanes to doe vs good by at length, and to make vs partakers of his righteouſneſſe, and more than Conquerours; yet the whileſt, a yoke will be a yoke and pinch, and lets will be lets, and the deuill like to himſelfe: there is no remedy of it; the remedy is in our being armed againſt them; and the members of the Militant Church.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But may not this ſeeme to trench vpon the Prouidence of our God, and the merit of Chriſt? might not he euen here quit vs of all theſe, and ſet vs in a ſtate of freedome?</hi>

                  <p>And for the obiection, I anſwere, The Lord cannot bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonoured in the way of his owne honour. As for vs, we are not capable of any other ſtate heere. For firſt, our abode here in an earthly Paradiſe is turned by the bounty of God to an heauenly abode with God: and therefore wee are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our iourney ſhould be like our home: and our ſea-faring as our hauen. Beſides what derogation were this to our head? that he, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. muſt ſuffer firſt and ſo enter into his glory, and we his members, put off our harneſſe? ſurely if hee (while he was heere) was burdened with all our ſinnes and ſorrowes, enemies and oppoſition; till his death (onely by this way, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. hee was exalted farre aboue all Angels) why ſhould we heere as pilgrims, looke for better meaſure?

                     <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, in our corrupt vnrenewed nature abiding ſtill. That is a wofull clogge and back-byas retarding our motion to

Alſo a moſt tedious contrariety in vs and perpetuall enemy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. luſts againſt the ſpirit, as a continuall dropping.

One pang of pride how doth it diſtaſt much grace, how much more then that ſpirit in vs which luſts to no other. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3.4.

I ſay theſe luſts doe ſnib and kill the groth of goodneſſe in the ſoule, and ouerdrip the grace of God as a ſowre ſhadow and the bowes of a Walnut tree doe keepe vnder ſome tender plant: or as the blaſting of the Eaſt wind, the bloſſomes,</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> In the actuall breakings out in open offences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177956:194"/> for firſt, how doe ſuch waſt and deuoure the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? how doe they defile the ſoule as naſty creatures doe their litter? what horror, what woe, repentance, complaints doe they cauſe? yea beſides vexations and troubles here, what ſtreights doe they bring a man vnto, by ſnaring him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once deluded, a man is as <hi>Sampſon</hi> hampered with his miſtris, vnable to get out of her fingers?</p>

And ſo when this alſo changes all our courſe of comfort into heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, brings God againſt vs in our bodies eſtates, poſterity, ſucceſſes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> after his adultery: or takes away ſpirit from our ſelues that our counſell is turned into fooliſhneſſe, and we bring ſorrow vpon our ſelues; or iuſtly arme men and enemies to make our liues weariſome to vs: how iuſt is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let no man ſay when he is tempted, &amp;c. but there tempting is not ſo aſcribed to our concupiſcence that it is denied of Satan, but onely remoued from God. I grant indeed we are Diuels to our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:177956:194"/> ſelues: but to deny alſo Satan to be one too, were pride and ſecurity, yea a ſpirit of Satan in vs, to ly againſt the Scriptures which tell vs, he was a lyar from the beginning, and ſo abides; and it's his element to be ſo, can be no otherwiſe, yea ſhould not be, except malitious, beſides thoſe texts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Leaſt as he beguiled Eue, &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Your aduerſary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill as a roaring Lyon, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> 1.7. <hi>From compaſſing the earth and walking in it:</hi> with a hundred more.</p>

Not the firſt, for it's iuſt with God that ſinne ſhould practiſe it ſelfe till that be out of meaſure ſinnefull, and ſo Satan deceiue, and ſinners be deceiued, for the mutuall miſery. Nor the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the moſt holy God well knowes out of this deadly poiſon of the bad wils of Satan and men, to worke forth his owne will to his glory: but without leaue, hee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhould Satan tempt vs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either by an externall way of perſwading by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of euill very aptly fitted and ſuted to our ſpirit (the frame whereof he knowes by our carriage) or elſe by an inſinuation of his ſubtile and ſpirituall wicked ſelfe into the ſpirits of man either the ſpirits of ſences, or fancies (as the temptations lye) and ſo to the reaſonable part. Euen as the plague ſauor, enters into the naturall and vitall ſpirits to deſtroy nature. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be, ſo it is: let vs rather learne to reſiſt him, then to queſtion a thing out of queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But if the Deuill tempt and ſin tempt too, how ſhall we know a difference?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is vſe I grant of this for ſome cauſes, eſpecially for ſtay to the minds of ſuch as are fouly tempted, yet I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that many who aske this queſtion, would rather ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the thing it ſelf, then deſcant about the cauſe. And firſt I ſay temptation may well and commonly is mixed of both Satan and corruption. But for anſwere briefely thus. In fiue different properties I would diſcerne theſe two. Firſt, by the groſeneſſe. Secondly, the irkeſomeneſſe. Thirdly, the pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and length. Fourthly, the impetuouſneſſe and violence of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:177956:195"/> them: Fifthly, The inſultation. The temptations from our ſelves doe not commonly reſemble theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> By groſſeneſſe, I meane fouleneſſe and odious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſinfulneſſe in the temptation. Corrupt nature is not ſo foully wicked as Satan; therefore temptations of this ranke, as to Atheiſme, to deny the Scriptures, not to reſt in luſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but to proceed to foule, vnnaturall, and outragious, hath more of Satan than corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the irkeſomeneſſe, I meane when temptations lye quite out of the tract and courſe of our ordinary inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and bents; as when a man exceedingly addicted to bee chaſt, or liberall, or confident in God, ſhall be buffeted with irkeſome obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cts of vncleanneſſe, or of baſeneſſe, or of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt of prouidence, whereof no reaſon appeares out of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nature. Theſe ſauour of Satan; as when <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. alway well occupied, findes an irkeſome <hi>pricke in the fleſh,</hi> to be vnapt to any good, praying or preaching, (for ſo I thinke God cured and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ented pride by eclipſing gifts and ſpirit.)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is pertinacy and length. Corruption is more fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and ſooner weary, than Satan who is more boundleſſe and full: therefore as the property of a Fly is to light vpon a galled plat, as oft as it is beaten off; ſo the Deuill (that god of Flyes) doth importunely, and vnweariedly tire and dog the ſoule with his temptations, hoping to doe that by tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which hee cannot by malice: So that to be neuer rid of a temptation is a third marke of Satan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The violence of them; that is, when he ſo fires his darts, that they come impetuouſly as a whirle-wind, ſo ſudden and boiſterous, that there is no time to reſiſt; but they come as if they were vnanſwerable, and the ſoule muſt yeeld, no remedy. Corruption, commonly, is more leiſurely, and more graduall, abhorring violence and hidiouſneſſe, as wee in ſome that haue in their heat rauiſhed Children, and others who deuoure themſelues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The inſulting and fury of temptation which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the fourth; that it comes with a trampling of the ſoule vnder feete with a diſdaine, as paſt all reſiſtance. If theſe markes bee in our temptations, wee may by the meſſengers
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177956:195"/> knocking, gheſſe <hi>the Maſters feet not to bee farre behinde.</hi> Oh what ſhould ſuch a point teach but this, what wee are, if God leaue vs? how curſed a ſpirit, and sky of evill we carry within vs? and therefore as to be comforted that they are not wholly our owne; ſo yet to begge of the Lord, mercy to ſtop the rage of our enemy, who if hee be let alone, is crueltie it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Well, come to the temptations themſelues; how many things conſider we in them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe two: The properties of the Tempter, and the ſubſtance of the Temptations.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are theſe properties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe; Firſt, Malice euer ſets him on worke againſt the body and ſoule of the Creature. Secondly, Vigilancy and attention alway doe aſſiſt his Temptations. Thirdly, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and woe is euer in the end thereof, to pull the ſoule from vnion and Communion with God. Fourthly, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and manner of his tempting, which is to bee weighed according to the parties tempted. If weake and vnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, he treads downe the low hedge, neuer troubling himſelfe further needleſly. And thus hee is himſelfe a Lyon; as <hi>Act.</hi> 16 27. the Iaylor being under terror, eaſily ſurprized, and as if the priſoners fled (for ſo he thought) would haue deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtabd himſelfe. The Deuill behind him, tels him, As good ſo as be executed; but by this hee would haue preuented his conuerſion. But if hee finde other obiects, and ſtrength of grace to reſiſt ſinne as ſinne, he goes another way to worke, <hi>to wit,</hi> by deuices and cunning, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. — As, firſt, to anticipate the counſell of the heart in preuenting ſinne, by the ſuddenneſſe of iniection. Thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. in the twinckling of an eye he had darted in his glorious bait of honour into our Saviour. Secondly, to aſſault iudgement and conſcience both at once, in blinding the one, and in binding the other: Thus he blinded <hi>Eve</hi> in that ſpeech, <hi>God knoweth that your eyes ſhall be open, and ye made as Gods.</hi> What was this, ſave to make obedience baſe, and ſinne ſweet? <hi>that is,</hi> In obeying, ye ſhall but ſerve the envy of an enemy. And your eating were to make ye better. So he did bleare <hi>Davids</hi> eye in <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:177956:196"/> caſe, knowing that elſe he had never preuailed: by <hi>Ziba,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he preſenting him as a Traitor, makes <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay, <hi>Why telleſt thou me of thy matters,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by his binding the will in poynt of her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and that by the exceſſiue ſweet of the bait. Thus to <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Bathſheba:</hi> Oh! Who would thinke a woman ſo goodly, ſo alluring, to be dangerous? A companion ſo fine ſpoken and complementall, to bee ſo ſinfull! This beares all downe. <hi>Sampſon</hi> went to ſee her who was precious in his eyes, that bleared him. Thirdly, by putting on the perſon of one vnſuſpected; as ſometime purſuers of a man will praiſe him to get others to betray him: and <hi>Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l</hi> to deceive <hi>Siſera,</hi> brought him Creame in a lordly diſh. And thus hee becomes an Angell of light, as holy as a Preacher. Thus hee tempts Chriſt to leape downe, and to make ſtones bread, out of a godly end (forſooth) that Gods power might be glorified in a miracle. Thus he tempts good men, you are well knowne to keepe good conſcience, to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing for ſo good an end; oh, who will ſee it? Avoid Deuill, God needs not my ſinne to honour himſelfe; I ſinne too much vnavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I need not adde ſinne to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. But when he knowes he cannot finally preuaile, it ſeemes foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for him to tempt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yea: If his wiſedome were from aboue; but it is <hi>earthly, ſenſuall and divelliſh:</hi> Therefore hee goes againſt the edge of his wiſedome, euen as his inſtruments doe, defiling themſelues in the things they know. If euer hee knew any, he knew our Sauiour to bee out of gun-ſhot; yet out of his fulneſſe of malice, he aſſaulted him bitterly. If he cannot keep the people of God from heauen, yet let it availe as it may, he will ſee if he can make them halt to heauen. And yet I may adde, that he hopes well to get many to himſelfe, who as yet ſome farre enough off; his hopes are impudent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.44. hee ſaith, I <hi>will returne, and bring ſeuen ſpirits worſe, &amp;c.</hi> Hee knowes not but he may doe ſo with any; but to be ſure, hee will not faile to try.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Proceed to the temptations themſelues?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe concerne the godly (for of the other I ſpeake not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177956:196"/> here, but in the firſt part,) ſince that theſe are Temptors both to themſelues and to others; and they are ruled by <hi>the Prince of the ayre, who rules in all the children of diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. and leads <hi>them as the Ox to the ſlaughter,</hi> out of their fat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and according to his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. Therefore, (to return) theſe concern them either in the point of their calling to be the Lords; or in poynt of their eſtate being called.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In how many reſpects about their firſt Calling?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either in Gods preuenting call, or his aſſiſting, or his perfecting. Touching his preuenting, thus: No ſooner doth hee ſee any ſinner make toward the voyce of God, to looke into his old courſe, or hearken after a new; but preſently hee ſets upon them euen in their entrance. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By preſenting old ſinnes, with all their circumſtances, order of them, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, haynouſneſſe, continuance, long contempt, &amp;c. to diſmay them from poſſibiltty of converſion. If they anſwer him, they had more need to ſeeke mercy, hee tells them, Its too late, God will not take the leauings, they ſhould haue giuen him their beſt ſtrength, courage, time, &amp;c. Or, hee aſſaults them with their weakneſſe of capacity, or memory, gifts, or parts, that they ſhall neuer compaſſe ſuch great things; Learned Wiſe men are too little for them. Or hee diſcourages them with their husbands ill will, the loſſe of fathers loue, and land; the worlds diſdaine, the reproach of their old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, yea, perhaps, brethren and kindred: Or, that the things they muſt forgoe both in liberties and luſts, are more than they can beare: that they ſhall neuer endure the trouble of Repentance, and change of heart, or at leaſt they will be of another minde when charge and trouble comes, and ſhall neuer perſeuere to the end. But, O Satan, avaunt: The Lord hath preuented me, and drawne mee out of darkeneſſe: ſhall he ſuffer me to periſh in light? No; as thy firſt aſſaults, ſo his grace will be moſt eager in my entrance to hold me out of thy clawes, and from reuolting.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How tempts he in the Aſſiſting grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Eſpecially in the firſt workes of the Law (which ſome referre to the former,) hee corrupts the minde and ſpirit both in the enlightning part, and the terrifying. The
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177956:197"/> former hee abuſeth to multiply the fearefull view of ſinne: The latter, to make terrour intolerable. Hee tempts to bee weary of this Diſcipline; tels them, ſome good people neuer had terror; that it will ſpoile their natures, (and ſo it will,) that they were beſt to put it by, for Mellancholly, and theſe Preachers will kill them: let them be merry, and ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with pleaſures, with eaſe and liberty, and then their ſenſes will be freſher, themſelves fitter for good. Now they are but dulled, and the Preacher will caſt downe ten, ere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one; and therefore leaue off with ſmall trouble rather than great: and, terror is not repentance neither, it can doe no good, but kill. And when many are thus ſnared, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelues by violence, deſpairing of any helpe. But if they grow to ſome hope by the Goſpell, (and not to make their hell another heauen,) then hee tempts them about the condition of the Promiſe, either for kinde or meaſure, that they neuer ſaw that ſweetneſſe in Chriſt which ſhould break their hearts: they neuer mourned enough, nor hungred, nor tooke paines aright, nor prized the Promiſe; or if they did, yet for neceſſity, or elſe out of ſelfe-loue? alas! they haue deſpiſed the Goſpel it ſelfe, and can grace ſaue them that haue hardned themſelues as well againſt it, as the Law? beſides, they ſee others called home long ſince, themſelues behinde; they are ſo vile, hardened, vnworthy, cannot pray, meditate, and therefore, God may doe much, but they are daily worſe rather than better; and ſo in the reſt: it is not condition can ſaue them, but faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And how in the worke of Beleening?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Here he labours to hold them vnder, eſpecially by their irkeſome bondage. Oh, ſaith he, Faith is onely of the Elect, and thou art none: it's the free gift of God, and he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it as well as grant it: Many haue come to the birth, and haue dyed ſo; and to beleeue, is a greater thing than to talke of. Sometimes hee makes it leſſe than it is, to puffe vp the heart with preſumption: Or, hee hides the vertuous ſavour and ſtrength of the Promiſe, the Simplicity, the Faithfulneſſe of the Promiſer, and the offer. Hee tells them, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they muſt be changed, (which is hardeſt of all) yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177956:197"/> than faile, hee will ſeeke to pull downe the whole frame of God ouer their head: fill them with temptations about the truth of the Scriptures, as if they were but fables, and Miniſters preacht their owne fancies: Hee poyſons them with melancholicke diſtempers and feares, askes them how they know this word which they ſo cleaue to, is the Word or not, puts worſe temptations into them; namely, whether there be any God or no. And (moſt vſually) keeps them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the doubt of the Condition, and the doubt of the Promiſe, to bee at uncertainties. But, oh poore ſoule, how ſhalt thou know thy Election ſaue by beleeuing? or what is that freedome of God, ſaue his bounty to the miſerable, and who are worthy (<hi>Revel.</hi> 3.4.) ſaue thoſe who are made ſo? Looke backe to that I haue written in Part 2. Article the laſt, and God ſtay thee.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Proceed to his temptations of them that are called?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Theſe concerne them either in point of their faith (and as touching the former, he tempteth two waies: either about the being, or the life of faith;) or elſe ſecondly, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How about the being?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thus: he takes aduantage of the weake ſetling at the firſt, and by that vnrenewedneſſe of nature, which oppoſes this ſpirituall grace, he ſeekes to ouerthrow them in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their confidence. He knowes this is their onely prop and therefore ſometime by ſhewing them how poore their fruits are, or how ſmall their humblings were, or what ſelfe-loue is mixed with their faith, or how deadly and dully they walke, or that they cannot appropriate Chriſt in each part of his merit, or by the like: hee concludes their faith is but temporary and no faith of the elect. And at ſuch a bay he holds ſome for lacke of knowledge, that they yeeld, and are ready vpon the leaſt Sermons touch, or obſeruing of other mens confidence (for many are too confident) or vpon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of any meanes to be vſed, or duty to bee done, or croſſe ſuffered, or the vrging of any priuiledge of a beleeuer, to ſtart and ſay, yea, if I had faith! But I haue none. Poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if thou euer hadſt it, thou yet haſt it: and therefore hold
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177956:198"/> that thou haſt got, 2 <hi>Iob.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How about the life of faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Exceedingly. For in truth, this prooues the other. Hee therefore knowing what aduantages he hath in this by either that naturall eaſe, ſloth and aweknes to enlarge the truth of one promiſe to all: and partly that willing want of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in this point, who chuſe rather to ſoder with God in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then obey him in nouriſhing their faith daily: hee doth very much prevaile: and by the ſmall life ſeekes to deſtroy the beeing of faith: If thou hadſt but faith as a grayne of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed, thou mightſt remoue mountaines: But alas, what faith haſt thou, who canſt not beare the ſuch a ſlight croſſe, a pette fillip of the finger, an ill word for thy proſeſſion, the loſſe of a little matter, Cow, or horſe? Nay, many that want, can beare more than thou. If thou liuedſt by faith either in ſtates, meanes, graces, or duties, thou wouldeſt bee otherwiſe then thou art? not ſo ſoone vnſetled: not ſo little growing, not ſo defectiue in the meaſure of grace, in vprightneſſe, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, &amp;c. But iet the reader reade of this, in the ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the life of faith. Take from Satan his chiefe weapon, thy careleſſe neglect, and the Lord ſhall ſticke to thee in point of weakeneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doth he aſſault in point of obedience?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either he tempts them about it, or againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How tempts he them about it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Thus: he buffets them in their comfort therein. For whereas it's Gods will that he that walkes vprightly, ſhould walke ſafely and ſweetly; lo, Satan ſeparates the end from the meanes. An hipocrite ſeperates the meanes from the end; looking for peace where there is no vprightneſſe. But heere the ſtratagem of the Deuill contrary; and therefore, either he hides that from his eye, which ſhould bee his maine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all failings: or elſe takes vantage by that which ſhould bee his humiliation, to bee his vtter diſcouragement. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he is rightly himſelfe in this: for as in the former point he belyes God to the ſoule, as if he could not ſupport it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by his promiſe in the life of faith, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. ſo here hee belyes the ſoule to it ſelfe and holds it in bondage. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177956:198"/> he cannot rob it of the truth of grace, yet he robs it of the comfort thereof, chuſing to play at any game, rather than ſit out. For the former of theſe, what is the ioy of a deere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God in his poore obedience, duties, Sabbaths, but that of <hi>Hezekiah, O Lord thou knoweſt I haue been vpright!</hi> This the Deuill hides away from the ſoule as the point of comfort by it, as if it were little worth for lack of meaſure. And then, whereas the want of meaſure, integrity, fruitfulneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſhould onely humble them, lo, it deiects them: Oh (ſay they) what good doe I, what ſerue I for? a very clod of the earth; what wife, husband, friend, neighbor or ſtranger fares the better for me? None liue ſo as I? ſo barren! Oh, put caſe it be true, it ſhould abaſe thee, but ſeeing there is vprightneſſe, it ſhould not diſmay thee. And looke what the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth moſt note by himſelfe to be amiſſe, that Satan takes for granted, to doe the ſoule moſt hurt by; Lo, theſe ſins thou confeſſeſt, therefore of thy owne mouth God may condemne thee. No, wofull enemy, for hee that confeſſes and forſakes them all, and would be as fruitfull as he is honeſt, as wiſe as he is vpright, ſhall not be caſt off. Oh! the wofull bordage that Satan holds vnder many a ſad heart, though ſincere, by melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and feare.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And how doth he tempt againſt obedience?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sundry wayes hee labours to bring the ſoule vnder ſin, to renounce a good courſe, to be ſlacke, remiſſe, looſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, prophane, vnprofitable, euen by conſent, And this is his moſt naturall temptation. For, as he is exceedingly wicked; ſo, its little to him that comfort be ſtopped, except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be waſted; now that he knowes ſinne againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will doe: and hereby bring God againſt a man alſo. As <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 31.16. ſeeing Sorcery could not curſe Iſrael, ſought to lay blocks of ſinne before them, that God might curſe them: Oh! What a May-game was it (thinke we) for him to ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> foyled by Adultery, <hi>Noah</hi> by drunkenneſſe, <hi>Lot</hi> by inceſt, <hi>Hezekia</hi> by pride, <hi>Peter</hi> by reuolt? How doth ſuch ſucceſſe put hopes into him, to keepe and practiſe his Trade vpon the beſt? Therefore here hee vſes all meanes to bring his purpoſes to paſſe. He takes vantage of each thing:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177956:199"/> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> He markes his ſeaſon and time, when the heart is moſt at eaſe, (as <hi>Abſalom</hi> noted <hi>Amnon</hi>) lying moſt open, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing garniſht, which, perhaps, another time would haue beene armed, iealous, and fearefull. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Bathſheba:</hi> Hee concurres not onely with the corruption of the heart, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but <hi>ſecondly,</hi> with the conſtitution and complexion of the ſpirit of nature in a man: Is he propenſe to luſt, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, to iouialneſſe, to ambition? Oh (ſaith he) hee is mine! I will tempt him with meet baits. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee watches the accomodation of occaſions; as when exceſſe of cheerefulneſſe, or of ſadneſſe, of praiſes or diſgraces, of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſucceſſe, or defeat, or the like; and when the ſpirits are open, then is his opportunity to worke the heart ro wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſpeech, to riot, to wrath and diſcontent, to ſwelling pride, to oſtentation of gifts, to the making away of a mans ſelfe, and the like. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hee will make vſe of their beſt Graces and Priuileges: all men know you well enough to be one that make conſcience, you may doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, and no man ſuſpect ye; therefore be not ſo nice in trifles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat an Orphan, oppreſſe the fatherleſſe, falſifie the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ye, &amp;c. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sometime of ſecrecie of time and place: who ſhall euer find it out: who is here (twenty mile from neighbours) to diſcouer thee? <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By fine colours of pretenſed meanings; as, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> meant well to the Church, why might they not meane well to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? So, by colour of iuſtice, my paines haue beene ſuch and ſuch in buſineſſe for others, why may not I pay my ſelfe ſo and ſo, they being neuer the wiſer; and, perhaps, neuer the worſe, as the caſe may ſtand? As once a wretch ſpake of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny giuen him for the poore, Who is poorer than my ſelfe? <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> By their falls, to driue them to ſinne for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, rather than to be puniſhed for a little, ouer ſhooes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knees: So, by comparing themſelues with worſe than themſelues, to be bold and preſumptuous in liberty-taking: By the oft ſhunning of ſinfull occaſions, to venture beyond their calling, and ſo be ſnared. Nay, by truths of God, both in examples of the Saints falles, why maieſt not thou doe ſo and repent? and in rules, that the beſt men haue their infirmities,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177956:199"/> and therefore why ſhould I be free? Infinite is this field (let the reſt of the ſheaues be brought to theſe bandes:) but if he can ſo dazle the heart till he haue ſnared vs, he will be content we ſhall afterward ſee in what pickle we are, get out how we can? Theſe for a taſte, although I might ſay that his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſoule being thus fallen, that it might not riſe againe; withholding the ſight of mercy, encreaſing either ſtupor of conſcience, our ſlauery of diſtruſt, and ſo wheeling off <hi>the ſoule till death, is worſe than the former. But I ceaſe.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> The whole world of evill may bee called either the dead world, or the liuing. I call it not dead, as if there were no perſwaſion in it, but to diſtinguiſh it in the manner of perſwading.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What meane you by the former?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not onely that the world is dead in ſinnes; but this, that the world, though ſhe doth not actually ſpeake out, yet her very guize doth defile and delude, and that in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: firſt, Examples: ſecondly Errors.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How by her Examples?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In theſe reſpects; 1. By imitation of them: 2. By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing them: 3. By the ſtreame of them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt; As in Droues the former ouen or ſheep lead all the reſt; ſo ſenſibleneſſe leads on ſinners by each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers examples. No way to defile and ſcatter ſinne ſo eaſily as this; rules would not ſo ſoone doe it. We are very apt by the eye or eare to follow bad, becauſe it goes with the haire. Inward luſt tickles; but examples doe much more perfect ſinne: <hi>Exod</hi> 22.2. <hi>Follow not a multitude</hi> (or the great ones) <hi>to ſinne.</hi> When Miniſters, Magiſtrates, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ones, ancient ones, and the greater part of theſe bee ring-leaders; people, ſubiects, ſimple, young, eaſily follow. Hence that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not faſhioned according to this world.</hi> The world hath a faſhioning qualitie in it, and one Ape will follow another: Man is ſociable: and as thoſe that liue in Cities, learne more than poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Village; ſo, ſinne committed in the view of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, taints more than concealed, or priuate. As we know a thing conueyed by a Pageant, or a ſong ſinkes deepli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; ſo here. That which men catch vp in Ale-houſes, Play-houſes, Fayres, meetings hath a pecullar fitneſſe to

                  <p>Q. <hi>How doth the world defile by exchange?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When no ſooner one hath lickt vp a bad example, but preſently hee retales it, and gaines thereby. As it is in Fame, it encreaſeth by paſſage; ſo with the ſinne of the world; Men thinke they muſt adde ſomewhat of their owne, to the ripening and making vp of it. If the Father teach the childe to ſweare, hee will teach his to forſweare: If one teach theft, another will teach ſacrilege: So it comes to paſſe, that ſinne abounds, and is growne out of meaſure ſinfull; each man putting off his owne art, skill, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the common ſtocke.</p>
                  <p>Its our nature, if wee haue a ſeed, to ſowe it, and ſee the proofe of it: and if a ſtocke of money, to put it into banke. Euery one ſowes this Darnell and Cockle; and ſinne hauing had long time to practiſe, is growne rich, plentifull, ſelfe-ſupporting, able to defend her ſelfe by all tricks, inuention, aequiuocation and deuices. As hee ſaid of a decaying world, we are dwarfes, and our children will bee Gnats; ſo I of the encreaſing, wee are ſtrong men, and the next will be gyants. We commit it, they will bee hardened and naturalized into a cuſtome of it; defend, extenuate and maintaine it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By the violence and irreſiſtibleneſſe thereof: For ſinne in the two former, will ſoone amount to a torrent or ſtreame of vniuerſality; ſo that none almoſt will bee found to reſiſt: and then as the neceſſity of an armed theefe is vpon a naked Traueller, ſo is the ſtreame to particular perſons.</p>
                  <p>As the Sodomits ſaid to <hi>Lot, Shall this man rule ouer vs:</hi> ſo ſaith the ſtreame of ſinne, Who ſhall controll vs? What, are they wiſer than the world?

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that which in one word the Apoſtle elegantly and pithily, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. calles the Diceplay of men, and <hi>cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, whereby they leade aſide to deceiue.</hi> Read it, and marke it. And it ſtands in the Art of the world in men deceiuing. And you may iudge it by theſe fiue branches of it. Error, firſt of tradition; ſecondly, of ſcandale; thirdly, in baſe and blind cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; fourthly, conceit; fifthly, coſenage.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are theſe? explaine them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The firſt is of tradition, which is when ſinne preuailes by ſucceſſion from man to man: Thus the errors of popery: and old ones new minted, pleading antiquity. Read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. he tells them they liued in ſinnes taught and obtaining, by the tradition of their fathers, from age to age. As it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of that heathen King when hee was brought to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſhrunke from it, asking, whether more of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors or fewer had beene babtiſed: and hearing that fewer had been, refuſed it, ſaying, I will doe as moſt haue done. Men loue to erre with a current of interpreters, then to ſpeake true with one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So thoſe Samaritans: compare 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. laſt, with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is ſcandale?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When the world, glad to riuet her ſelfe in euill, deludes her ſelfe with the offences of hipocrites; and by their ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals layes blocks in mens way, that they might ſtumble at the truth. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 7. Wo to the world becauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: (both giuen and taken) God iuſtly ſuffers damnable hipocrites to play their parts, both to detect them and to ſnare the prophane: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. The wicked ſhall waxe worſe and worſe, deceiuing, and being deceiued. Love, (ſay men) what this great preacher, or profeſſor is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? and euen of this ſtampe are they all: neither barrell better herring. By this error, thouſands are quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Cuſtome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is that error which deceiues by preſcription of long vſe. Thus diuorces preuailed to bee lawes among the Iewes
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:177956:201"/> being lawleſſe things; becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> had permitted them: and ſo at this day, Cuſtomes of Games, Dancings, Fayres upon the Sabbaths, Wakes, and drunken feaſts, with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch vpon ſuch and ſuch daies are ſwallowed without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcruple. Cuſtome growing another nature: every Preacher. Magiſtrate, and Law pulling them vp, ſauing thoſe that trie. That old Canon of the Greeke Councell ſtill being in force, Let old Cuſtomes preuaile. Good ones are puld vp as a tender new ſet plant; bad ones, as old Okes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is conceit and opinion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Error againſt goodneſſe, by preiudice: See <hi>Act. ult. We know that this Sect is euery where ill spoken of.</hi> This is the worlds leauen in the three peckes of meale of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, till all bee leauenned. Thus wicked men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme themſelves in euill, take vp baſe, triuiall conceits and errours againſt the way, the ſeruants and Ordinances of Chriſt, which being once giuen out, proue irreuocable: See <hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 28.12. The Prieſts gaue large mony to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to giue it out that Chriſt was ſtollen away: and this preuailed long after againſt the Reſurrection. So men ſpeake of the godly, Tuſh, doe yee beleeue them? I warrant yee they can breake their promiſes, bee as hard, and couetous as others. This new learning neuer did good; wee liued better ere it came: there was better houſe-keeping, love among neighbours: your greateſt Profeſſors ſhutting their doores, and liuing in ſome corner of London to ſpend all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new faſhions, or elſe to hoard vp for their Children. And ſo they ſpeake of the good Miniſtry; they doe but driue men out of their wits: they are factious and turbulent. And in old times, the world reported of the faithfull, that they met in the night, and after their deuotions, put out their lights, and fell to vncleanneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Coſenage?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> That Trade, of which mainly that Text treats, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4:18. whereby falſe Teachers, ſchiſmatiks and Hereticks blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their conceits: wreſting their wits to abuſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſet falſe Colors vpon their opinions.

                     <hi>A.</hi> Partly in words, partly in deedes. The former are the open corrupt Counſels of ſinners, or their ſecret inſinuations.

So doe wicked preachers ſcatter their falſe tenents, or principles of prophanneſſe to taint mens iudgments or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> wofull enemies of our peace. It is a word ſoone ſpoken, but of long and hard practice; to ſtand, I ſay, vpon our guard, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a little I would direct about it: though I feele my ſelfe in a ſea of matter, yet I will ſend my Reader to large and godly Treatiſes of this vaſt argument, and my ſelfe cull out two or three directions beſt agreeing to my drift.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Begin then firſt with the firſt annoyance or let, which is our owne corruption; how is that to be reſiſted?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> I will mention three wayes: 1. The ſpiritual combat ere ſin be brought into act: 2. Watchfulneſſe againſt outward oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and temptations: 3. Wiſedome after we are fallen:</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the duty of the Combat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is the exerciſe of that holy Principle of the Spirit of the new Creature, which perpetually fighteth againſt the fleſh in the regenerate. Let this bee perpetually maintained, and the hand of Faith, or of Chriſt, rather bee continually iogged by vs, for the liuely quickening grace thereof, to reſiſt our inward ſelfe-temptations: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Spirit luſteth againſt the Fleſh;</hi> and ye cannot be as ye would. There is in the New Creature a renuing throughout in euery part, yet not throughout in all. As in a dead Palſey, all one ſide dead,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:177956:204"/> yet the other wholly aliue. How doth the liuing part fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dead? If a man ſhould haue a dead carkaſſe bound to his backe till he dyed, were it not an heavy plague? would it not be irkeſome? So this body of death to the liuing part of the new Creature. Oh, mourne and grone it out: The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſay, <hi>Every deepe ſigh ſpends a drop of bloud.</hi> Oh that thy grones might conſume this bloud? I likened it before to <hi>Peninna,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. Let <hi>Hanna</hi> then bee to <hi>Peninna,</hi> as ſhee (to bee ſure) will be to her, Shee will not ſee the leaſt looke of <hi>Elkana</hi> toward her, the leaſt loue-token, not one nights lodging, not one caſt of favour, but ſhee will pine at it, vpbraid her for it, vexe at, and grudge her the leaſt drop. Oh! Let <hi>Hanna</hi> doe ſo to her: Let her, all that ſhee can, get into her husbands heart, and the more ſhee is envyed, the more let her cling to him, that his loue may ſupport her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her enemy: let him be to her aboue all her feares. Oh, if this were, how happy were we?</p>
                  <p>It's ſaid of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that ſhe <hi>was weary of her life</hi> for <hi>Eſaw's wives</hi> (as I noted) and wiſht them out of doores. Let vs be like her; and ſay, Oh Lord, theſe baſe dogging thoughts of ſinne which breed ill affections, and threaten to breake forth daily into action, how noyſome are they? When <hi>Rebecca</hi> felt <hi>a ſtrugling,</hi> ſhe asked the cauſe of the Lord; and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Wonder not, <hi>there be two nations in thee, a curſed, and a bleſſed one;</hi> one whom I have hated, another loued: it muſt be thus, wait thy time, pray for a good trauel, the whilſt thou muſt beare this ſtrife within thee. So doe thou; doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare it, but maintaine it alſo. Say to the Lord, I can neuer ſhunne euill, but I am the more tempted to it: never enſue goodneſſe, but I am driuen from it: Lord, why is it thus? Oh quicken vp that loue, that Image of thy righteouſneſſe, that ſeed of God, that inner man of the Spirit, which may preſent thee ſo to my ſoule, that thy ſweetneſſe and love may cauſe the Image of old luſt to be deſpiſed, &amp; decay daily more and more: Create in my ſoule that holy nature of thine which may for euer abhor, foile &amp; conquer this fleſh, and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it in me: Thou, oh Lord, art as holy, as ſin is wicked. Oh Lord ſhew it, and the preuailing nature of it; let it burne
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177956:204"/> vpon the Altar of my ſoule, againſt the Altar of corruption: Oh that I could find but one day of many, that I were mine owne, and free to righteouſneſſe, rid of my cumber and clog! That I could feele thoſe ſecret motions and inſtincts of ſin in me, rebelling againſt thee, tickling mee, ſnaring, and leading me captiue, being as ſenſible and wake to marke and diſcouer them, and nip them in the necke, as they are to annoy me.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the ſecond duty of watching?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Continually to obſerue and preuent occaſions offered, when we cannot foile inward motions. Cut off her prouiſion, and ſterue ſin. As men deale with fields of weeds which they cannot root up, they hooke them, and ſo kill them by oft cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their tops: ſo doe thou with occaſions, obiects, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, prouocation to thy wrath, reuenge, couetouſneſſe: main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſound deſire to abhorre them, that they neuer enter thy trenches. The welcomming of obiects is as caſting of oyle into the fire. As <hi>Iob</hi> for his ſonnes, ſo be thou for thy ſelfe. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice daily</hi> for mercy of preuention, remouing of vanities which might annoy thee, eſpecially naturall ones; or if offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet for grace to defie them, and goe to worke by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Iealouſie and feare are bleſſed from heauen to preſerue thee: as the eye-lids are made moueable and winking, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to keepe out any mote or annoyance. If this watching heart againſt obiects were kept, and no roguiſh ſtragler ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to paſſe without ſtop and examination whence and whither, how ſweet ſhould our courſe be?</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the third duty of wiſedome?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not to bee kept in bondage by Satan in point of our recouerie out of our falls, if wee bee ſlipt into any; but ſpeedily to gather vp our ſelues, ere wee bee hardened; <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Shall a man fall, and not ariſe?</hi> Be not ſullen as the loaden iade in the ſlowe, that will not ſtirre to get out. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan get thee at this bay, hee hath his hearts wiſh. But rather goe backe, wound thy ſoule for thy reuolt, ſeeke to the Lord for ſtaying of thee; if thou haue beene bold with the Lord, recall thy ſelfe, let thine heart ſmite thee, and ſay, <hi>I will doe ſo no more, Iob</hi> 40.4. and ſo lay hold upon the Promiſe, repent, and doe thy former works; be zealous and amend. Doe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177956:205"/> not ſoder vp thy breaches with a dead heart, weighing good actions againſt bad, which will harden thee: but returne to him whom thou haſt ſinned againſt: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.29. <hi>If thou haue beene angry and ſinned, adde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ot drunkenneſſe to thirſt;</hi> wrath and malice and reuenge, to thy paſſion, but <hi>ere the Sunne goe downe,</hi> goe to God for mercy and put it to an end, that the next Sun riſe finde thee not hardned.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Proceede to the ſecond next: what courſe is to bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other two enemies, Satan and the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Briefely to put them together: beſides what I haue ſaid already, put on the compleate armour of proofe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there by the Lord in this caſe, and keepe it cloſe to thee, weare it and walke in it as the Armour of a child of light, as the harneſſe of the militant Church and each member of Chriſt, bleſſed by him to that purpoſe. They bee not as Pope holy ſwords, or armour bleſſed by a ſinnefull wretch to no purpoſe: but bleſſed by God, and they ſhall be ſo. They bee no charmed weapons, but ſtrong in God to caſt downe holds and forts of ſtrong enemies. <hi>Firſt,</hi> therefore let me giue thee ſome generall counſell and then a few particulars, about the pieces of the armor. For the generall, theſe two: firſt, get wiſedome to diſcouer and diſcerne his temptations. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>2</label> be armed againſt them. Firſt, I ſay diſcouer them: The Apoſtle thought hee ſpake a great word, when hee ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 11. <hi>you know his deuices,</hi> as if a man warned were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. To ſay the truth, it is a great thing to bee warned. Get wiſdome then: diſcerne him in his properties, diſcerne him in his firſt onſets in thy firſt calling, begin this act betimes for it is long: and be aſſured he wil not ſo let thee paſſe, but be the more eager againſt thee in thy faith, thy comfort, thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He wil ſet wife, husband, children, thy betters, thy equals in aray againſt thee. Know him ere hee come himſelfe by his meſſenger: and think not it will be anſwer ſufficient that thou knewſt nothing. Aske poyſon if it will not hurt, becauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known? or an enemy if he will turne from thy Caſtle, becauſe he hath ſurptiz'd it ere thou wert aware. Was it not ſuppoſed thou ſhouldſt haue knowne? Let the Lord ſay of thee, <hi>Thou knoweſt his deuices.</hi> And ſo know them, as being of a different
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177956:205"/> kind and nature, not all alike. Some temptations are not like to be durable, becauſe ſo hideous; as to Atheiſme, againſt the Scriptures, to blaſpheme &amp; deny God and prouidence. Theſe will wanze. Here learne two things: Firſt, Take heed leſt being rid of theſe, thou be ſecure of the next; know theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run others. And ſecondly, know, that ſeeing theſe being meerely, or moſtly Satans, and not thine, thou oughteſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch them as faſt as they come, by abhorring them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abaſed by them, but not diſmayed by their hidiouſneſſe. Then againe, there are temptations on the left hand, and on the right hand; both may not be taken for alike. For temptations on the right hand to ſenſuall euils, admit not that parley, nor plodding upon in thy minde, which ſome others doe, the thought whereof is fearefull. But rather, the more they are thought of, the more they ſhare a man. Doe as the Prophet to <hi>Iehoram, Anſwer roughly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kin. 6.32</note> Like to the breaches of two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; which, the more ript vp, the more they exulcerate: And ſo I might ſay of many more. Let the concluſion bee, Learne wiſely to iudge of temptations, deuils, or worlds; and let thy long acquaintance with his method, make thee skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; praying for the ſpirit of diſcerning, and confeſſing how much thou art miſ-matched. Secondly, be armed accordingly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Branch </seg>2</label> and ſtand ſo againſt him daily and conſtantly; for this battell hath no truce. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.17. <hi>In vaine is the net laid for that which hath wing;</hi> for the Bird mounts vp aboue the ſnare.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177956:206"/> of the temptation, but our armour againſt it, which preſerues vs; ſhall God giue vs armour and we not vſe it? Shall it hang vp a ruſting by vs, &amp; we pierced with darts to death for want of it? They ſay of great Souldiers, they are ſhot-free. The Lords armed ones are all ſo, while armed: elſe as other men. Therefore let this teach vs not to commit our ſelues to this world naked and vnarmed: vnder hope of ſhot freedome. <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. taking his horſe to ruſh into the maine battell, was requeſted to forbeare; but he anſwered, <hi>an Emperour was neuer ſhot through with a bullet.</hi> This confidence hath an armed ſouldier of Chriſt, neuer was beleeuer ſhot to death by a diuel or a wicked world. To diſcouer theſe enemies is good but to ſtand in our dayly armor, and to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, to quite vs like men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. is a better grace. It is not our vaine wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of ſelfe-confidence, learning, experience, wit or parts: no not our great reſolutions, our deep vowes againſt oathes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, or the like, will ſaue vs: or that we ſcorne the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil as the ſlaue of God. What ſhall it boot vs to ſcorne him as a ſlaue of God, when he is our tyrant? Therefore neither feare him ſlauiſhly nor ſcorne him prophanely but be armed, wiſely and conſtantly, &amp; watch to it with prayer, &amp; the Lord ſhalbe with thy endeauour, and teach thy hands to fight &amp; preuaile.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 6. from 14. verſe to the 18.</note>Q. <hi>But in a word, how ſhould the parts of the Armour be vſed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If once truly put on, they ſhall bee vſed the more eaſily. The moſt bleſſed part of thy Armour is faith, which puts on all the reſt: and doth (as the ſhield) not onely defend thee but all thy armour alſo. It is that grace which carries a poore ſoule into the field with like courage to <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. <hi>Who is this dog that defieth the hoſt of Iſrael? This day ſhall God incloſe thee in mine hand.</hi> It argueth thus: firſt, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if euer Satan or world could haue foyled me, it had been in my onſet, my freſh-water ſouldier: but euen then the Lord kept me: againſt a Beare and a Lyon, and ſhall he keepe me, to deſtroy me? I haue been kept from him in my firſt call to God, and ſhall I not now much more being armed. I am the Lords: he will couer my head in the day of battell. Againe it diſputes for God againſt her own weaknes, by proofe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall aſſiſtance: I ſee, indeede, ſtronger than I haue beene
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177956:206"/> foyled, but the Lord can bring a weake nouice through, as well as a ſtrong man; the Battell is the Lords: <hi>Race is not with the ſwift, nor the Battell with the ſtrong:</hi> But he that fights as well with few and weake, as ſtrong and many, giues victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as he pleaſeth. And as when wee ſee a weake weariſh old man of 80 yeeres, we wonder ſo weake an one ſhould ſo hold out, when thouſands of ſtronger, dye in their ſtrength: ſo here; yet beleeue that ſo it may be, and he that in all our brunts and ſtreights hath kept vs, and as the fierie dart hath beene caſt at vs, hath latcht it for vs, and (to ſhew what he can doe for a poore wretch) hath brought me through ſo many pikes of Deuil or world already, can he not doe ſo ſtill? Thus faith, in temptation by deuill, malice of inſtruments, is <hi>more than a Conquerour:</hi> not to ſhun temptations, but not to be conſumed euen in the burning. And Faith claſpes here to a merit of Chriſt her Captaine, by a word or promiſe: <hi>I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: the gates of hel ſhal not preuaile againſt it:</hi> I haue ouercome the world, be of good courage, &amp; the like. Theſe faith cleaues to, and puts all her ſtrength vpon them. The Lord Ieſus hath diſarmed this ſtrong Gyant, triumphed ouer him on the Croſſe, and led him, and all his, captiuitie captiue; and they fight againſt mee but with the dregs of courage and policy, ſince he ouercame them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they keepe on the helmet of hope on their head, as a woman would doe her hat in a wet iourney: They looke at that final redemption and victory which is ſet before them when their harneſſe are off: and this holds vp their faith, which elſe by one or other temptation would be foiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. as Chriſt, who for the hope ſet before him, endured the ſhame: ſo theſe endure the heat of this battell, knowing it ſhal one day ioy them to haue been ſo occupied, and the end ſhall pay for all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the peace of conſcience treads downe all, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> trod down his enemies, horſe and foot, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 15.8. For why? this peace of God rules their hearts &amp; minds: they are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrongly, but they will not loſe their peace, and buy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at ſo deree a rate. Their precious peace they will not change for any deuils or worlds pleaſure. If they ſhould loſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:177956:207"/> it to win the world, what ſhou'd it profit them? <hi>Shall</hi> I (<hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.) <hi>forſake my fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe to exalt my ſelfe?</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. The falſe mother cared not for cutting the child, but the true mother trembled at it: So, the true child of God cries, ſaue my peace, whatſoeuer I forgoe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe next their heart, as a Corſlet of proofe preſerues them: Lord, thou knoweſt righteouſnes and obedience, innocency toward thee and men hath alway bin deerer to mee then goods ill gotten, then all ſpoiles, all pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, all baits of men, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and threats: They have lighted vpon my breſt-plate, and beene daſhed. And, through thy mercie, by whatſoeuer darts Satan beguile me, I hope theſe ſhall not, while I can keep my integrity. As good <hi>Iob</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 27.5.</note> ſaid to his enemies, <hi>My righteouſneſſe ſhall ye neuer take from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Their Girdle of truth and ſincerity; not of tongue onely, but of ſoule, not looking with <hi>Balaam,</hi> at baſe ends, but truly at the honour of God, whoſe loue I can proue, becauſe hee vpholds me in my integrity.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the Sword of the Spirit, the Armoury of God his Word, that offenſiue weapon by which the ſoule is able not onely to ſaue her ſelfe, but to cruſh and foyle her aduerſarie: the Lord hauing put into his Word, that authoritie which no Deuil can reſiſt; eſpecially, when it is wiſely, ſparily, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably vſed; not to dally with Satan, but to bruſh him off, as the Butchers flap beats off, and cruſhes the flies. As we ſee in thoſe apt Scriptures, which <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. our Saviour uſed; and by vſing, bleſſed to vs: when we ſhal (according to our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) by faith, retort Satan with them. And thus I haue giuen a ſhort taſt of a thouſand which might haue beene added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching the Lord to bleſſe them, and the whole doctrine of this Article which here I conclude.</p>

See for this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>All things are yours, and yee are Christs, and Chriſt is Gods, Heb.</hi> 12.15, 16. <hi>But yee are come to mount Zion, to the Citie of the living God, &amp;c.</hi> read it at large. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an holy nation, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Why, theſe ſeeme no other then were ſpoken of in Part</hi> 2. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> 4. <hi>in the Benefits of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for although both ſorts are benefits from one Fountaine, yet the difference is this; of thoſe former wee conſiſt and are. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Of him are we, who is made to vs, &amp;c.</hi> But by theſe wee doe not properly conſiſt, but wee are much the better for them, and the one concernes our being,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177956:208"/> as Reconciliation, Adoption: the other our wel-being; as, That Gods Angels are our Miniſters and Guardians: all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs for the beſt, with a thouſand ſuch more. It is one thing to be a man; another, the Lord of Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But are they not the ſame with the meanes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No doubtleſſe: The meanes although they are rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the Church, and (in reſpect of ſtrangers) priuileges alſo; yet they are no ſuch prerogatiues in themſelues (ſaue in their efficacie to the elect) but are given to all as ordinances, either for begetting or building vp: and therefore concerne them who are as yet vncalled, by the right of Baptiſme. But theſe belong to the Beleeuer onely.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What differ they from Commandements? for many of them are things which God requires of vs: as, to grow in grace, to abſtaine and keepe themſelues from open offences, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> True: yet the things being the ſame, the reſpect is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; they are not priuileges properly, as commanded: but as they are allowances from God to enable and qualifie the ſoule to performe the things which God commandeth.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>In what doth their nature conſiſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In theſe two: Firſt, in their price and worth: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in their peculiarity: If we ſeuer either for other, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a priuilege. For the former:</p>
                  <p>Firſt Their price is in this: The leaſt of them coſt the blood of the Lord Ieſus, and flow from his ſides: their nature is excellent, gracious and glorious; their vſe is ſutable, for they attend the well-fare of the beſt creature in the world; and the inſtrument of obtaining them, is no leſſe than that whereby Iuſtification is gotten: Laſtly, they are the Legacies of the laſt Will and Teſtament of Chriſt, ſealed with his death, and pledges of his preſence, till wee enioy himſelfe; ſeruing to conduct vs homeward in a tolerable manner, as many bayting places to refreſh vs, till wee come thither.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are peculiar things as well as precious: ſo, ours, that no others portion beſides vs; we know peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth greatly beautifie a precious thing. As then theſe belong to the whole Body of Chriſt, to one as another,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177956:208"/> and to each member from the whole body: ſo no other but ſhe can enioy it: A ſtranger ſhall not enter into her ioy. For as the Lord doth at the firſt make his Church a peculiar gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, of a meere thicket and queach of buſhes, a dunghill, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe in which there is no delight: as if a man ſhould take ſuch an vnſhapen place, and build himſelfe a ſumptuous Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace with Gardens and Orchards, and dwellings of pleaſure and fruit: ſo hauing once done ſo, and ſet his delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee pitches there, and delights to take it vp as his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.13. Hence thoſe phraſes which the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.10. <hi>To you it is giuen, not to others, Ioh.</hi> 17 9. <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>A peculier people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 19.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. <hi>You ſhall bee my peculiar ones,</hi> though all the World is mine. They are called his <hi>iewels and pretious ones, Malach.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In how many kinds doe theſe preuiledges benefit the Church of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In two. For as all peculiars and liberties doe either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne either ſome indemnity and freedome from annoyance, or ſome right and title to benefits: ſo doth the whole body of priuiledges either concerne her riddance from the burdens which lye vpon others: (as, to find no bleſſing to bee theirs but to anſwere for them:) or an enlargement to thoſe good things which others cannot come by: as to bee kept from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in ſtreights, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Diſtinguiſh them into their ſeuerall heads and ſorts?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Generally, firſt, they belong to the beleeuer either firſt, heere, or ſecondly, hereafter. Heere, either in life, or at death. In this life, we enioy priuiledges, either accompanying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion or following it. Thoſe that accompany our conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are righteouſneſſe, peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.17.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the conſequent priuiledges hereupon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either they concerne our perſons or our eſtates. Our perſons (or the perſons of ours, for God ſo eſteems them) thus. That <hi>God it ours</hi> and theirs in couenant and will be ſo for euer, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54, <hi>This is to me as the waters of Noa, &amp;c. He will be our God reconciled (yeſterday to day and for euer, Heb.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>and our God all-ſufficient,</hi> ſo that in nothing wee need to take thought, for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177956:209"/> hee <hi>takes thought for vs, Philip.</hi> 4.6. and 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.7. So alſo, <hi>No good thing ſhall bee wanting, light or defence, grace or glory, Pſalme</hi> 84. <hi>All things ſhall worke together for our good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things are ours inright,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and in right vſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>His Angels are Miniſtring Spirits</hi> for our watch and good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They are temporall, or ſpirituall. To both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon this doth belong, that God will doe for vs in both, aboue all that we can aske or thinke, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. and ſupply abundantly all our wants: he will ſupply our bodily wants, pouerty, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wits and ſences; as our ſight and hearing, or ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes: and our ſpirituall, as want of knowledge, faith, patience much more of Sabbaths, ordinances, good helpes of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp;c. And beſides in neither eſtate will hee require any more of vs then according to our abilities, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. not according to what we want, but that wee haue. If wee bee poore, and cannot doe what wee would: if wee bee weake in grace, and faith, hee lookes at our talents and no further, ſo we be faithfull in that little, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the priuiledges of our temporall eſtate?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Our temporall reaches to our eſtate of the world, and it concernes either bleſſings or croſſes: touching bleſſings, firſt, that whatſoeuer is meete for body, for meat, drinke, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, health, life, good dayes, ſucceſſe, welfare, good marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, credit and the like, ſhall be giuen vs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. <hi>Wee need not feare it.

                     <hi>A.</hi> Some concerne God, ſome our ſelues. Touching God this: All his adminiſtrations ſhall profit vs, hee will diſcouer himſelfe in them to vs: in the way of his gouernment of the Age and times wee liue in: in his bleſſings vpon his owne, and iudgments vpon his enemies: his patience and carriage towards our ſelues in our whole courſes: the ſundry chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
